Well, I must say that uh - Mr. Truman has uh - his methods of expressing things; he's been in politics for fifty years; he's been president of the United States.
They may - are not my style.
But I really don't think there's anything that I could say to President Truman that's going to cause him, at the age of seventy-six, to change his particular speaking manner.
Perhaps Mrs. Truman can, but I don't think I can.
I'll just have to tell Mr. Morton that.
If you'd pass that message on to him.
Any comment, Mr. Vice President?
Yes, I think so.
Of course, both er - Senator Kennedy and I have felt Mr. Truman's ire; and uh - consequently, I think he can speak with some feeling on this subject.
I just do want to say one thing, however.
We all have tempers; I have one; I'm sure Senator Kennedy has one.
But when a man's president of the United States, or a former president, he has an obligation not to lose his temper in public.
One thing I've noted as I've traveled around the country are the tremendous number of children who come out to see the presidential candidates.
I see mothers holding their babies up, so that they can see a man who might be president of the United States.
I know Senator Kennedy sees them, too.
It makes you realize that whoever is president is going to be a man that all the children of America will either look up to, or will look down to.
And I can only say that I'm very proud that President Eisenhower restored dignity and decency and, frankly, good language to the conduct of the presidency of the United States.
And I only hope that, should I win this election, that I could approach President Eisenhower in maintaining the dignity of the office; in seeing to it that whenever any mother or father talks to his child, he can look at the man in the White House and, whatever he may think of his policies, he will say: "Well, there is a man who maintains the kind of standards personally that I would want my child to follow."
Mr. Cater's question is for Vice President Nixon.
Mr. Vice President, I'd like to return just once more, if I may, to this area of dealing with the Communists.
Critics have claimed that on at least three occasions in recent years - on the sending of American troops to Indochina in 1954, on the matter of continuing the U-2 flights uh - in May, and then on this definition of the - of our commitment to the offshore island - that you have overstated the Administration position, that you have taken a more bellicose position than President Eisenhower.
Just two days ago you said that you called on uh - Senator Kennedy to serve notice to Communist aggressors around the world that we're not going to retreat one inch more any place, where as we did retreat from the Tachen Islands, or at least Chiang Kai-shek did.
Would you say this was a valid criticism of your statement of foreign policy?
Well, Mr. Cater, of course it's a criticism that uh - is being made.
Uh - I obviously don't think it's valid.
I have supported the Administration's position and I think that that position has been correct; I think my position has been correct.
As far as Indochina was concerned, I stated over and over again that it was essential during that period that the United States make it clear that we would not tolerate Indochina falling under Communist domination.
Now, as a result of our taking the strong stand that we did, the civil war there was ended; and today, at least in the south of Indochina, the Communists have moved out and we do have a strong, free bastion there.
Now, looking to the U-2 flights, I would like to point out that I have been supporting the President's position throughout.
I think the President was correct in ordering these flights.
I think the President was correct, certainly, in his decision to continue the flights while the conference was going on.
I noted, for example, in reading a - uh - a - a particular discussion that Senator Kennedy had with Dave Garroway shortly after the uh - his statement about regrets, that uh - he made the statement that he felt that these particular flights uh - were ones that shouldn't have occurred right at that time, and the indication was how would Mr. Khrushchev had felt if we had uh - had a flight over the uni- how would we have felt if Mr. Khrushchev ha - uh - had a flight over the United States while uh - he was visiting here.
And the answer, of course, is that Communist espionage goes on all the time.
The answer is that the United States can't afford to have a es- an es - a espionage lack or should we s- uh - lag - or should I say uh - an intelligence lag - any more than we can afford to have a missile lag.
Now, referring to your question with regard to Quemoy and Matsu.
What I object to here is the constant reference to surrendering these islands.
Senator Kennedy quotes the record, which he read from a moment ago, but what he forgets to point out is that the key vote - a uh - vote which I've referred to several times - where he was in the minority was one which rejected his position.
Now, why did they reject it?
For the very reason that those Senators knew, as the President of the United States knew, that you should not indicate to the Communists in advance that you're going to surrender an area that's free.
Why?
Because they know as Senator Kennedy will have to know that if you do that you encourage them to more aggression.
Senator Kennedy?
Well number one on Indochina, Mr. Nixon talked in - before the newspaper editors in the spring of 1954 about putting, and I quote him, "American boys into Indochina."
The reason Indochina was preserved was the result of the Geneva Conference which Indochina.
Number two, on the question of the U-2 flights.
I thought the.
U-2 flight in May just before the conference was a mistake in timing because of the hazards involved, if the summit conference had any hope for success.
I never criticized the U-2 flights in general, however.
I never suggested espionage should stop.
It still goes on, I would assume, on both sides.
Number three, the Vice President - on May fifteenth after the U-2 flight - indicated that the flights were going on, even though the Administration and the President had canceled the flights on May twelfth.
Number three, the pre - Vice President suggests that we should keep the Communists in doubt about whether we would fight on Quemoy and Matsu.
That's not the position he's taking.
He's indicating that we should fight for these islands come what may because they are, in his words, in the area of freedom.
He didn't take that position on Tibet.
He didn't take that position on Budapest.
He doesn't take that position that I've seen so far in Laos.
Guinea and Ghana have both moved within the Soviet sphere of influence in foreign policy; so has Cuba.
I merely say that the United States should meet its commitments to Que- to uh - Formosa and the Pescadores.
But as Admiral Yarnell has said, and he's been supported by most military authority, these islands that we're now talking about are not worth the bones of a single American soldier; and I know how difficult it is to sustain troops close to the shore under artillery bombardment.
And therefore, I think, we should make it very clear the disagreement between Mr. Nixon and myself.
He's extending the Administration's commitment.
Mr. Drummond's question is for Senator Kennedy.
Uh - Mr. Kennedy, Representative Adam Clayton Powell, in the course of his speaking tour in your behalf, is saying, and I quote: "The Ku Klux Klan is riding again in this campaign.
If it doesn't stop, all bigots will vote for Nixon and all right-thinking Christians and Jews will vote for Kennedy rather than be found in the ranks of the Klan-minded."
End quotation.
Governor Michael DiSalle is saying much the same thing.
What I would like to ask, Senator Kennedy, is what is the purpose of this sort of thing and how do you feel about it?
Well the que- the - Mr. Griffin, I believe, who is the head of the Klan, who lives in Tampa, Florida, indicated a - in a statement, I think, two or three weeks ago that he was not going to vote for me, and that he was going to vote for Mr. Nixon.
I do not suggest in any way, nor have I ever, that that indicates that Mr. Nixon has the slightest sympathy, involvement, or in any way imply any inferences in regard to the Ku Klux Klan.
That's absurd.
I don't suggest that, I don't support it.
I would disagree with it.
Mr. Nixon knows very well that in this - in this whole matter that's been involved with the so-called religious discussion in this campaign, I've never suggested, even by the vaguest implication, that he did anything but disapprove it.
And that's my view now.
I disapprove of the issue.
I do not suggest that Mr. Nixon does in any way.
Mr. Vice President.
Well I welcome this opportunity to join Senator Kennedy completely on that statement and to say before this largest television audience in history something that I have been saying in the past and want to - will always say in the future.
On our last television debate, I pointed out that it was my position that Americans must choose the best man that either party could produce.
We can't settle for anything but the best.
And that means, of course, the best man that this nation can produce.
And that means that we can't have any test of religion.
We can't have any test of race.
It must be a test of a man.
Also as far as religion is concerned.
I have seen Communism abroad.
I see what it does.
Communism is the enemy of all religions; and we who do believe in God must join together.
We must not be divided on this issue.
The worst thing that I can think can happen in this campaign would be for it to be decided on religious issues.
I obviously repudiate the Klan; I repudiate anybody who uses the religious issue; I will not tolerate it, I have ordered all of my people to have nothing to do with it and I say - say to this great audience, whoever may be listening, remember, if you believe in America, if you want America to set the right example to the world, that we cannot have religious or racial prejudice.
We cannot have it in our hearts.
But we certainly cannot have it in a presidential campaign.
Mr. McGee has a question for Vice President Nixon.
Mr. Vice President, some of your early campaign literature said you were making a study to see if new laws were needed to protect the public against excessive use of power by labor unions.
Have you decided whether such new laws are needed, and, if so, what would they do?
Mr. McGee, I am planning a speech on that subject next week.
Uh - Also, so that we can get the uh - opportunity for the questioners to question me, it will be before the next television debate.
Uh - I will say simply, in advance of it, that I believe that in this area, the laws which should be passed uh - as far as the big national emergency strikes are concerned, are ones that will give the president more weapons with which to deal with those strikes.
Now, I have a basic disagreement with Senator Kennedy, though, on this point.
He has taken the position, when he first indicated in October of last year, that he would even favor compulsory arbitration as one of the weapons the president might have to stop a national emergency strike.
I understand in his last speech before the Steelworkers Union, that he changed that position and indicated that he felt that government seizure might be the best way to stop a strike which could not be settled by collective bargaining.
I do not believe we should have either compulsory arbitration or seizure.
I think the moment that you give to the union, on the one side, and to management, on the other side, the escape hatch of eventually going to government to get it settled, that most of these great strikes will end up being settled by government, and that will be a - be in the end, in my opinion, wage control; it would mean price control - all the things that we do not want.
I do believe, however, that we can give to the president of the United States powers, in addition to what he presently has in the fact finding area, which would enable him to be more effective than we have been in handling these strikes.
One last point I should make.
The record in handling them has been very good during this Administration.
We have had less man-hours lost by strikes in these last seven years than we had in the previous seven years, by a great deal.
And I only want to say that however good the record is, it's got to be better.
Because in this critical year - period of the sixties we've got to move forward, all Americans must move forward together, and we have to get the greatest cooperation possible between labor and management.
We cannot afford stoppages of massive effect on the economy when we're in the terrible competition we're in with the Soviets.
Senator, your comment.
Well, I always have difficulty recognizing my positions when they're stated by the Vice President.
I never suggested that compulsory arbitration was the solution for national emergency disputes.
I'm opposed to that, was opposed to it in October, 1958.
I have suggested that the president should be given other weapons to protect the national interest in case of national emergency strikes beyond the injunction provision of the Taft-Hartley Act.
I don't know what other weapons the Vice President is talking about.
I'm talking about giving him four or five tools - not only the fact-finding committee that he now has under the injunction provision, not only the injunction, but also the power of the fact-finding commission to make recommendations - recommendations which would not be binding, but nevertheless would have great force of public opinion behind them.
One of the additional powers that I would suggest would be seizure.
There might be others.
By the president having five powers - four or five powers - and he only has very limited powers today, neither the company nor the union would be sure which power would be used; and therefore, there would be a greater incentive on both sides to reach an agreement themselves without taking it to the government.
The difficulty now is the president's course is quite limited.
He can set up a fact-finding committee.
The fact-finding committee's powers are limited.
He can provide an injunction if there's a national emergency for eighty days, then the strike can go on; and there are no other powers or actions that the president could take unless he went to the Congress.
This is a difficult and sensitive matter.
But to state my view precisely, the president should have a variety of things he could do.
He could leave the parties in doubt as to which one he would use; and therefore there would be incentive, instead of as now - the steel companies were ready to take the strike because they felt the injunction of eighty days would break the union, which didn't happen.
The next question is by Mr. Cater for Senator Kennedy.
Uh - Mr. Kennedy, uh - Senator - uh - Vice President Nixon says that he has costed the two party platforms and that yours would run at least ten billion dollars a year more than his.
You have denied his figures.
He has called on you to supply your figures.
Would you do that?
Yes, I have stated in both uh - debates and state again that I believe in a balanced budget and have supported that concept during my fourteen years in the Congress.
The only two times when an unbalanced budget is warranted would be during a serious recession - and we had that in fifty-eight in an unbalanced budget of twelve billion dollars - or a national emergency where there should be large expenditures for national defense, which we had in World War II and uh - during part of the Korean War.
On the question of the cost of our budget, I have stated that it's my best judgment that our agricultural program will cost a billion and a half, possibly two billion dollars less than the present agricultural program.
My judgment is that the program the Vice President put forward, which is an extension of Mr. Benson's program, will cost a billion dollars more than the present program, which costs about six billion dollars a year, the most expensive in history.
We've spent more money on agriculture in the last eight years than the hundred years of the Agricultural Department before that.
Secondly, I believe that the high interest-rate policy that this Administration has followed has added about three billion dollars a year to interest on the debt - merely funding the debt - which is a burden an the taxpayers.
I would hope, under a different monetary policy, that it would be possible to reduce that interest-rate burden, at least a billion dollars.
Third, I think it's possible to gain a seven hundred million to a billion dollars through tax changes which I believe would close up loof- loopholes on dividend withholding, on expense accounts.
Fourthly, I have suggested that the medical care for the aged - and the bill which the Congress now has passed and the President signed if fully implemented would cost a billion dollars on the Treasury - out of Treasury funds and a billion dollars by the states - the proposal that I have put forward and which many of the members of my party support is for medical care financed under Social Security; which would be financed under the Social Security taxes; which is less than three cents a day per person for medical care, doctors' bills, nurses, hospitals, when they retire.
It is actuarially sound.
So in my judgment we would spend more money in this Administration on aid to education, we'd spend more money on housing, we'd spend more money and I hope more wisely on defense than this Administration has.
But I believe that the next Administration should work for a balanced budget, and that would be my intention.
Mr. Nixon misstates my figures constantly, which uh - is of course his right, but the fact of the matter is: here is where I stand and I just want to have it on the public record.
Mr. Vice President?
Senator Kennedy has indicated on several occasions in this program tonight that I have been misstating his record and his figures.
I will issue a white paper after this broadcast, quoting exactly what he said on compulsory arbitration, for example, and the record will show that I have been correct.
Now as far as his figures are concerned here tonight, he again is engaging in this, what I would call, mirror game of "here-it-is-and-here-it-isn't."
Uh - On the one hand, for example, he suggests that as far as his medical care program is concerned that that really isn't a problem because it's from Social Security.
But Social Security is a tax.
The people pay it.
It comes right out of your paycheck.
This doesn't mean that the people aren't going to be paying the bill.
He also indicates as far as his agricultural program is concerned that he feels it will cost less than ours.
Well, all that I can suggest is that all the experts who have studied the program indicate that it is the most fantastic program, the worst program, insofar as its effect on the farmers, that the - America has ever had foisted upon it in an election year or any other time.
And I would also point out that Senator Kennedy left out a part of the cost of that program - a twenty-five percent rise in food prices that the people would have to pay.
Now are we going to have that when it isn't going to help the farmers?
I don't think we should have that kind of a program.
Then he goes on to say that he's going to change the interest-rate situation and we're going to get some more money that way.
Well, what he is saying there in effect, we're going to have inflation.
We're going to go right back to what we had under Mr. Truman when he had political control of the Federal Reserve Board.
I don't believe we ought to pay our bills through inflation, through a phony interest rate.
Next, Mr. Drummond's question for Vice President Nixon.
Uh - Mr. Nixon uh - before the convention you and Governor Rockefeller said jointly that the nation's economic growth ought to be accelerated; and the Republican platform states that uh - the nation needs to quicken the pace of economic growth.
Uh - Is it fair, therefore, Mr. Vice President, to conclude that you feel that there has been insufficient economic growth during the past eight years; and if so, what would you do beyond uh - present Administration policies uh - to step it up?
Mr. Drummond, I am never satisfied with the economic growth of this country.
I'm not satisfied with it even if there were no Communism in the world, but particularly when we're in the kind of a race we're in, we have
