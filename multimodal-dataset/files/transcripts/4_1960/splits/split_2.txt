But there was a period there when Poland demonstrated a national independence and even the Polish government moved some differn- di- distance away from the Soviet Union.
I suggested that we amend our legislation so that we could enjoy closer economic ties.
We received the support first of the Administration and then not, and we were defeated by one vote in the Senate.
We passed the bill in the Senate this year but it didn't pass the House.
I would say Eastern Europe is the area of vulnerability of the uh - s- of the Soviet Union.
Secondly, the relations between Russia and China.
They are now engaged in a debate over whether war is the means of Communizing the world or whether they should use subversion, infiltration, economic struggles and all the rest.
No one can say what that course of action will be, but I think the next president of the United States should watch it carefully.
If those two powers should split, it could have great effects throughout the entire world.
Thirdly, I believe that India represents a great area for affirmative action by the free world.
India started from about the same place that China did.
Chinese Communists have been moving ahead the last ten years.
India under a free society has been making some progress.
But if India does not succeed - with her four hundred and fifty million people, if she can't make freedom work - then people around the world are going to determine - particularly in the underdeveloped world - that the only way that they can develop their resources is through the Communist system.
Fourth, let me say that in Africa, Asia, Latin America, Eastern Europe, the great force on our side is the desire of people to be free.
This has expressed itself in the revolts in Eastern Europe.
It's expressed itself in the desire of the people of Africa to be independent of Western Europe.
They want to be free.
And my judgment is that they don't want to give their freedom up to become Communists.
They want to stay free, independent perhaps of us, but certainly independent of the Communists.
And I believe if we identify ourselves with that force, if we identify ourselves with it as Lincoln, as Wilson did, as Franklin Roosevelt did, if we become known as the friend of freedom, sustaining freedom, helping freedom, helping these people in the fight against poverty and ignorance and disease, helping them build their lives, I believe in Latin America, Africa, and Asia, eventually in the Eastern Europe and the Middle East, certainly in Western Europe, we can strengthen freedom.
We can make it move.
We can put the Communists on the defensive.
Your comment, Mr. Vice President?
First, with regard to Poland, when I talked to Mr. Gomulka, the present leader of Poland, for six hours in Warsaw last year, I learned something about their problems and particularly his.
Right under the Soviet gun, with Soviet troops there, he is in a very difficult position in taking anything independent, a position which would be independent of the Soviet Union.
And yet let's just see what we've done for Poland, A half a billion dollars worth of aid has gone to Poland, primarily economic, primarily to go to the people of Poland.
This should continue and it can be stepped up to give them hope and to keep alive the hope for freedom that I can testify they have so deeply within them.
In addition we can have more exchange with Poland or with any other of the Iron Curtain countries which show some desire to take a different path than the path that has been taken by the ones that are complete satellites of the Soviet Union.
Now as far as the balance of the world is concerned, I of course don't have as much time as Senator Kennedy had.
I would just like to s- add this one point.
If we are going to have the initiative in the world, we must remember that the people of Africa and Asia and Latin America don't want to be pawns simply in a struggle between two great powers - the Soviet Union and the United States.
We have to let them know that we want to help them, not because we're simply trying to save our own skins, not because we're simply trying to fight Communism; but because we care for them, because we stand for freedom, because if there were no Communism in the world, we would still fight poverty and misery and disease and tyranny.
If we can get that across to the people of these countries, in this decade of the sixties, the struggle for freedom will be won.
John Chancellor's question for Vice President Nixon.
Sir, I'd like to ask you an- another question about Quemoy and Matsu.
Both you and Senator Kennedy say you agree with the President on this subject and with our treaty obligations.
But the subject remains in the campaign as an issue.
Now is - sir, is this because each of you feels obliged to respond to the other when he talks about Quemoy and Matsu, and if that's true, do you think an end should be called to this discussion, or will it stay with us as a campaign issue?
I would say that the issue will stay with us as a campaign issue just as long as Senator Kennedy persists in what I think is a fundamental error.
He says he supports the President's position.
He says that he voted for the resolution.
Well just let me point this out; he voted for the resolution in 1955 which gave the president the power to use the forces of the United States to defend Formosa and the offshore islands.
But he also voted then for an amendment - which was lost, fortunately - an amendment which would have drawn a line and left out those islands and denied the p- right to the president to defend those islands if he thought that it was an attack on Formosa.
He repeated that error in 1959, in the speech that he made.
He repeated it again in a television debate that we had.
Now, my point is this: Senator Kennedy has got to be consistent here.
Either he's for the President and he's against the position that those who opposed the President in fifty-five and fifty-nine - and the Senator's position itself, stated the other day in our debate - either he is for the President and against that position or we simply have a disagreement here that must continue to be debated.
Now if the Senator in his answer to this question will say "I now will depart, or retract my previous views; I think I was wrong in I 955; I think I was wrong in 1959; and I think I was wrong in our television debate to say that we should draw a line leaving out Quemoy and Matsu - draw a line in effect abandoning these islands to the Communists;" then this will be right out of the campaign because there will be no issue between us.
I support the President's position.
I have always opposed drawing a line.
I have opposed drawing a line because I know that the moment you draw a line, that is an encouragement for the Communists to attack - to step up their blackmail and to force you into the war that none of us want.
And so I would hope that Senator Kennedy in his answer today would clear it up.
It isn't enough for him to say "I support the President's position, that I voted for the resolution."
Of course, he voted for the resolution - it was virtually unanimous.
But the point is, what about his error in voting for the amendment, which was not adopted, and then persisting in it in fifty-nine, persisting in it in the debate.
It's very simple for him to clear it up.
He can say now that he no longer believes that a line should be drawn leaving these islands out of the perimeter of defense.
If he says that, this issue will not be discussed in the campaign.
Senator Kennedy, your comment.
Well, Mr. Nixon, to go back to 1955.
The resolution commits the president in the United States, which I supported, to defend uh - Formosa, the Pescadores, and if it was his military judgment, these islands.
Then the President sent a mission, composed of Admiral Radford and Mr. Robertson, to persuade Chiang Kai-shek in the spring of fifty-five to withdraw from the two islands, because they were exposed.
The President was unsuccessful; Chiang Kai-shek would not withdraw.
I refer to the fact that in 1958, as a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, I'm very familiar with the position that the United States took in negotiating with the Chinese Communists on these two islands.
General Twining, in January, fifty-nine, described the position of the United States.
The position of the United States has been that this build-up, in the words of the president, has been foolish.
Mr. Herter has said these islands are indefensible.
Chiang Kai-shek will not withdraw.
Because he will not withdraw, because he's committed to these islands, because we've been unable to persuade him to withdraw, we are in a very difficult position.
And therefore, the President's judgment has been that we should defend the islands if, in his military judgment and the judgment of the commander in the field, the attack on these islands should be part of an overall attack on Formosa.
I support that.
In view of the difficulties we've had with the islands, in view of the difficulties and disputes we've had with Chiang Kai-shek, that's the only position we can take.
That's not the position you took, however.
The first position you took, when this matter first came up, was that we should draw the line and commit ourselves, as a matter of principle, to defend these islands.
Not as part of the defense of Formosa and the Pescadores.
You showed no recognition of the Administration program to try to persuade Chiang Kai-shek for the last five years to withdraw from the islands.
And I challenge you tonight to deny that the Administration has sent at least several missions to persuade Chiang Kai-shek's withdrawal from these islands.
Under the agreed
And that's the testimony of uh - General Twining and the Assistant Secretary of State in fifty-eight.
Under the agreed rules, gentlemen, we've exhausted the time for questions.
Each candidate will now have four minutes and thirty seconds for his closing statement.
Senator Kennedy will make the first final closing statement.
I uh - said that I've served this country for fourteen years.
I served it uh - in the war.
I'm devoted to it.
If I lose this election, I will continue in the Senate to try to build a stronger country.
But I run because I believe this year the United States has a great opportunity to make a move forward, to make a determination here at home and around the world, that it's going to reestablish itself as a vigorous society.
My judgment is that the Republican party has stood still here in the United States, and it's also stood still around the world.
Uh - We're using about fifty percent of our steel capacity today.
We had a recession in fifty-eight.
We had a recession in fifty-four.
We're not moving ahead in education the way we should.
We didn't make a judgment in fifty-seven and fifty-six and fifty-five and fifty-four that outer space would be important.
If we stand still here, if we appoint people to ambassadorships and positions in Washington who have a status quo outlook, who don't recognize that this is a revolutionary time, then the United States does not maintain its influence.
And if we fail, the cause of freedom fails.
I believe it incumbent upon the next president of the United States to get this country moving again, to get our economy moving ahead, to set before the American people its goals, its unfinished business.
And then throughout the world appoint the best people we can get, ambassadors who can speak the language - no mere - not merely people who made a political contribution but who can speak the language.
Bring students here; let them see what kind of a country we have.
Mr. Nixon said that we should not regard them as pawns in the cold war; we should identify ourselves with them.
If that were true, why didn't we identify ourselves with the people of Africa?
Why didn't we bring students over here?
Why did we suddenly offer Congo three hundred students last June when they had the tremendous revolt?
That was more than we had offered to all of Africa before from the federal government.
I believe that this party - Republican party - has stood still really for twenty-five years - its leadership has.
It opposed all of the programs of President Roosevelt and others - the minimum wage and for housing and economic growth and development of our natural resources, the Tennessee Valley and all the rest.
And I believe that if we can get a party which believes in movement, which believes in going ahead, then we can reestablish our position in the world - strong defense, strong in economic growth, justice for our people, co- guarantee of constitutional rights, so that people will believe that we practice what we preach, and then around the world, particularly to try to reestablish the atmosphere which existed in Latin America at the time of Franklin Roosevelt.
He was a good neighbor in Latin America because he was a good neighbor in the United States; because they saw us as a society that was compassionate, that cared about people, that was moving this country ahead.
I believe it my responsibility as the leader of the Democratic party in 1960 to try to warn the American people that in this crucial time we can no longer afford to stand still.
We can no longer afford to be second best.
I want people all over the world to look to the United States again, to feel that we're on the move, to feel that our high noon is in the future.
I want Mr. Khrushchev to know that a new generation of Americans who fought in Europe and Italy and the Pacific for freedom in World War II have now taken over in the United States, and that they're going to put this country back to work again.
I don't believe that there is anything this country cannot do.
I don't believe there's any burden, or any responsibility, that any American would not assume to protect his country, to protect our security, to advance the cause of freedom.
And I believe it incumbent upon us now to do that.
Franklin Roosevelt said in 1936 that that generation of Americans had a rendezvous with destiny.
I believe in 1960 and sixty-one and two and three we have a rendezvous with destiny.
And I believe it incumbent upon us to be the defenders of the United States and the defenders of freedom; and to do that, we must give this country leadership and we must get America moving again.
Now, Vice President Nixon, your closing statement.
Senator Kennedy has said tonight again what he has said several times in the course of this - these debates and in the campaign, that American is standing still.
America is not standing still.
It has not been standing still.
And let's set the record straight right now by looking at the record, as Al Smith used to say.
He talks about housing.
We built more houses in the last seven years than in any Administration and thirty percent more than in the previous Administration.
We talk about schools - three times as many classrooms built in the past Administration - and Eisenhower - than under the Truman Administration.
Let's talk about civil rights.
More progress in the past eight years than in the whole eighty years before.
He talks about the progress in the field of slum clearance and the like.
We find four times as many projects undertaken and completed in this Administration than in the previous one.
Anybody that says America has been standing still for the last seven and a half years hasn't been traveling in America.
He's been in some other country.
Let's get that straight right away.
Now the second point we have to understand is this, however.
America has not been standing still.
But America cannot stand pat.
We can't stand pat for the reason that we're in a race, as I've indicated.
We can't stand pat because it is essential with the conflict that we have around the world that we not just hold our own, that we not keep just freedom for ourselves.
It is essential that we extend freedom, extend it to all the world.
And this means more than what we've been doing.
It means keeping America even stronger militarily than she is.
It means seeing that our economy moves forward even faster than it has.
It means making more progress in civil rights than we have so that we can be a splendid example for all the world to see - a democracy in action at its best.
Now, looking at the other parts of the world - South America - talking about our record and the previous one.
We had a good neighbor policy, yes.
It sounded fine.
But let's look at it.
There were eleven dictators when we came into power in 1953 in Latin America.
There are only three left.
Let's look at Africa.
Twenty new countries in Africa during the course of this Administration.
Not one of them selected a Communist government.
All of them voted for freedom - a free type of government.
Does this show that Communism has the bigger pull, or freedom has the bigger pull?
Am I trying to indicate that we have no problems in Africa or Latin America or Asia?
Of course not.
What I am trying to indicate is that the tide of history's on our side, and that we can keep it on our side, because we're on the right side.
We're on the side of freedom.
We're on the side of justice against the forces of slavery, against the forces of injustice.
But we aren't going to move America forward and we aren't going to be able to lead the world to win this struggle for freedom if we have a permanent inferiority complex about American achievements.
Because we are first in the world in space, as I've indicated; we are first in science; we are first in education, and we're going to move even further ahead with the kind of leadership that we can provide in these years ahead.
One other point I would make: what could you do?
Senator Kennedy and I are candidates for the presidency of the United States.
And in the years to come it will be written that one or the other of us was elected and that he was or was not a great president.
What will determine whether Senator Kennedy or I, if I am elected, was a great president?
It will not be our ambition that will determine it, because greatness is not something that is written on a campaign poster.
It will be determined to the extent that we represent the deepest ideals, the highest feelings and faith of the American people.
In other words, the next president, as he leads America and the free world, can be only as great as the American people are great.
And so I say in conclusion, keep America's faith strong.
See that the young people of America, particularly, have faith in the ideals of freedom and faith in God, which distinguishes us from the atheistic materialists who oppose us.
