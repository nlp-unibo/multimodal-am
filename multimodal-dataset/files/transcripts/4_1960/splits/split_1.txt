for Mr. Khrushchev to come in, to come into Latin America and to engage us in what would be a civil war, and possibly even worse than that.
This is the major recommendation that he's made.
Now, what can we do?
Well, we can do what we did with Guatemala.
There was a Communist dictator that we inherited from the previous Administration.
We quarantined Mr. Arbenz.
The result was that the Guatemalan people themselves eventually rose up and they threw him out.
We are quarantining Mr. Castro today.
We're quarantining him diplomatically by bringing back our Ambassador; economically by cutting off trade, and Senator Kennedy's suggestion that the trade that we cut off is not significant is just one hundred percent wrong.
We are cutting off the significant items that the Cuban regime needs in order to survive.
By cutting off trade, by cutting off our diplomatic relations as we have, we will quarantine this regime so that the people of Cuba themselves will take care of Mr. Castro.
But for us to do what Senator Kennedy has suggested would bring results which I know he would not want, and certainly which the American people would not want.
Mr. Nixon uh - shows himself i- misinformed.
He surely must be aware that most of the equipment and arms and resources for Castro came from the United States, flowed out of Florida and other parts of the United States to Castro in the mountains.
There isn't any doubt about that, number one.
Number two, I believe that if any economic sanctions against Latin America are going to be successful they have to be multilateral.
They have to include the other countries of Latin America.
The very minute effect of the action which has been taken this week on Cuba's economy - I believe Castro can replace those markets very easily through Latin America, through Europe, and through Eastern Europe.
If the United States had stronger prestige and influence in Latin America it could persuade - as Franklin Roosevelt did in 1940 - the countries of Latin America to join in an economic quarantine of Castro.
That's the only way you can bring real economic pressure on the Castro regime - and also the countries of Western Europe, Canada, Japan and the others.
Number three, Castro is only the beginning of our difficulties throughout Latin America.
The big struggle will be to prevent the influence of Castro spreading to other countries - Mexico, Panama, Bolivia, Colombia.
We're going to have to try to provide closer ties, to associate ourselves with the great desire of these people for a better life if we're going to prevent Castro's influence from spreading throughout all of Latin America.
His influence is strong enough today to prevent us from joi- getting the other countries of Latin America to join with us in economic quarantine.
His influence is growing - mostly because this Administration has ignored Latin America.
You yourself said, Mr. Vice President, a month ago, that if we had provided the kind of economic aid five years ago that we are now providing we might never have had Castro.
Why didn't we?
John Edwards has his first question for Senator Kennedy.
Senator Kennedy, one test of a new president's leadership will be the caliber of his appointments.
It's a matter of interest here and overseas as to who will be the new secretary of state.
Now, under our rules, I must ask this question of you, but I would hope that the Vice President also would answer it.
Will you give us the names of three or four Americans, each of whom, if appointed, would serve with distinction in your judgment as secretary of state?
Mr. Edwards, I don't think it's a wise idea for presidential candidates to appoint the members of his cabinet prospectively, or to suggest four people - indicate that one of them surely will be appointed.
This is a decision that the president of the United States must make.
The last candidate who indicated that he knew who his cabinet was going to be was Mr. Dewey in 1948.
This is a race between the Vice President and myself for the presidency of the United States.
There are a good many able men who could be secretary of state.
I've made no judgment about who should be secretary of state.
I think that judgment could be made after election, if I'm successful.
The people have to make a choice between Mr. Nixon and myself, between the Republican party and the Democratic party, between our approach to the problems which now disturb us as a nation and disturb us as a world power.
The president bears the constitutional responsibility, not the secretary of state, for the conduct of foreign affairs.
Some presidents have been strong in foreign policy; others have relied heavily on the secretary of state.
I've been a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee; I run for the presidency with full knowledge that his great responsibility, really, given to him by the Constitution and by the force of events, is in the field of foreign affairs.
I'm asking the people's support as president.
We will select the best man we can get.
But I've not made a judgment, and I have not narrowed down a list of three or four people, among whom would be the candidate.
Mr. Vice President, do you have a comment?
Well Mr. Edwards, as you probably know, I have consistently answered all questions with regard to who will be in the next cabinet by saying that that is the responsibility of the next president, and it would be inappropriate to make any decisions on that or to announce any prior to the time that I had the right to do so.
So that is my answer to this question.
If you don't mind, I'd like to use the balance of the time to respond to one of the comments that Senator Kennedy made on the previous question.
Eh- He was talking about the Castro regime and what we had been eh- doing in Latin America.
I would like to point out that when we look at our programs in Latin America, we find that we have appropriated five times as much for Latin America as was appropriated by the previous Administration; we find that we have two billion dollars more for the Export-Import Bank; we have a new bank for Latin America alone of a billion dollars; we have the new program which was submitted at the Bogota Conference - this new program that President Eisenhower submitted, approved by the last Congress - for five hundred million dollars.
We have moved in Latin America very effectively, and I'd also like to point this out: Senator Kennedy complains very appropriately about our inadequate ra- radio broadcasts for Latin America.
Let me point out again that his Congress - the Democratic Congress - has cut eighty million dollars off of the Voice of America appropriations.
Now, he has to get a better job out of his Congress if he's going to get us the money that we need to conduct the foreign affairs of this country in Latin America or any place else.
Walter Cronkite, you have your first question for Vice President Nixon.
Thank you Quincy.
Mr. Vice President, Senator Fulbright and now tonight, Senator Kennedy, maintain that the Administration is suppressing a report by the United States Information Agency that shows a decline in United States prestige overseas.
Are you aware of such a report, and if you are aware of the existence of such a report, should not that report, because of the great importance this issue has been given in this campaign, be released to the public?
Mr. Cronkite, I naturally am aware of it, because I, of course, pay attention to everything Senator Kennedy says, as well as Senator Fulbright.
Now, in this connection I want to point out that the facts simply aren't as stated.
First of all, the report to which Senator Kennedy refers is one that was made many, many months ago and related particularly to the uh - period immediately after Sputnik.
Second, as far as this report is concerned, I would have no objection to having it made public.
Third, I would say this with regard to this report, with regard to Gallup Polls of prestige abroad and everything else that we've been hearing about "what about American prestige abroad": America's prestige abroad will be just as high as the spokesmen for America allow it to be.
Now, when we have a presidential candidate, for example - Senator Kennedy - stating over and over again that the United States is second in space and the fact of the matter is that the space score today is twenty-eight to eight - we've had twenty-eight successful shots, they've had eight; when he states that we're second in education, and I have seen Soviet education and I've seen ours, and we're not; that we're second in science because they may be ahead in one area or another, when overall we're way ahead of the Soviet Union and all other countries in science; when he says as he did in January of this year that we have the worst slums, that we have the most crowded schools; when he says that seventeen million people go to bed hungry every night; when he makes statements like this, what does this do to American prestige?
Well, it can only have the effect certainly of reducing it.
Well let me make one thing clear.
Senator Kennedy has a responsibility to criticize those things that are wrong, but he has also a responsibility to be right in his criticism.
Every one of these items that I have mentioned he's been wrong - dead wrong.
And for that reason he has contributed to any lack of prestige.
Finally, let me say this: as far as prestige is concerned, the first place it would show up would be in the United Nations.
Now Senator Kennedy has referred to the vote on Communist China.
Let's look at the vote on Hungary.
There we got more votes for condemning Hungary and looking into that situation than we got the last year.
Let's look at the reaction eh - reaction to Khrushchev and Eisenhower at the last U.N. session.
Did Khrushchev gain because he took his shoe off and pounded the table and shouted and insulted?
Not at all.
The President gained.
America gained by continuing the dignity, the decency that has characterized us and it's that that keeps the prestige of America up, not running down America the way Senator Kennedy has been running her down.
Comment, Senator Kennedy?
I really don't need uh - Mr. Nixon to tell me about what my responsibilities are as a citizen.
I've served this country for fourteen years in the Congress and before that in the service.
I've just as high a devotion, just as high an opinion.
What I downgrade, Mr. Nixon, is the leadership the country is getting, not the country.
Now I didn't make most of the statements that you said I made.
The s- I believe the Soviet Union is first in outer space.
We have - may have made more shots but the size of their rocket thrust and all the rest - you yourself said to Khrushchev, "You may be ahead of us in rocket thrust but we're ahead of you in color television" in your famous discussion in the kitchen.
I think that color television is not as important as rocket thrust.
Secondly, I didn't say we had the worst slums in the world.
I said we had too many slums.
And that they are bad, and we ought to do something about them, and we ought to support housing legislation which this Administration has opposed.
I didn't say we had the worst education in the world.
What I said was that ten years ago, we were producing twice as many scientists and engineers as the Soviet Union and today they're producing twice as many as we are, and that this affects our security around the world.
And fourth, I believe that the polls and other studies and votes in the United Nations and anyone reading the paper and any citizen of the United States must come to the conclusion that the United States no longer carries the same image of a vital society on the move with its brightest days ahead as it carried a decade or two decades ago.
Part of that is because we've stood still here at home, because we haven't met our problems in the United States, because we haven't had a moving economy.
Part of that, as the Gallup Polls show, is because the Soviet Union made a breakthrough in outer space.
Mr. George Allen, head of your Information Service, has said that that made the people of the world begin to wonder whether we were first in science.
We're first in other areas of science but in space, which is the new science, we're not first.
John Chancellor, your first question for Senator Kennedy.
Senator, another question uh - in connection with our relations with the Russians.
There have been stories from Washington from the Atomic Energy Commission hinting that the Russians may have resumed the testing of nuclear devices.
Now if - sir, if this is true, should the United States resume nuclear testing, and if the Russians do not start testing, can you foresee any circumstances in 1961 in which the United States might resume its own series of tests?
Yes, I think the next president of the United States should make one last effort to secure an agreement on the cessation of tests, number one.
I think we should go back to Geneva, who's ever elected president, Mr. Nixon or myself, and try once again.
If we fail then, if we're unable to come to an agreement - and I hope we can come to an agreement because it does not merely involve now the United States, Britain, France, and the Soviet Union as atomic powers.
Because new breakthroughs in atomic energy technology there's some indications that by the time the next president's term of office has come to an end, there may be ten, fifteen, or twenty countries with an atomic capacity, perhaps that many testing bombs with all the effect that it could have on the atmosphere and with all the chances that more and more countries will have an atomic capacity, with more and more chance of war.
So one more effort should be made.
I don't think that even if that effort fails that it will be necessary to carry on tests in the atmosphere which pollute the atmosphere.
They can be carried out underground, they c- could be carried on in outer space.
But I believe the effort should be made once more by who's ever elected president of the United States.
If we fail, it's been a great serious failure for everyone - for the human race.
I hope we can succeed.
But then if we fail responsibility will be clearly on the Russians and then we'll have to meet our responsibilities to the security of the United States, and there may have to be testing underground.
I think the Atomic Energy Committee is prepared for it.
There may be testing in outer space.
I hope it will not be necessary for any power to resume uh - testing in the atmosphere.
It's possible to detect those kind of tests.
The kind of tests which you can't detect are underground or in - in uh - perhaps in outer space.
So that I'm hopeful we can try once more.
If we fail then we must meet our responsibilities to ourselves.
But I'm most concerned about the whole problem of the spread of atomic weapons.
China may have it by 1963, Egypt.
War has been the constant companion of mankind, so to have these weapons disseminated around the world, I believe means that we're going to move through a period of hazard in the next few years.
We ought to make one last effort.
Any comment, Mr. Vice President?
Yes.
I would say first of all that we must have in mind the fact that we have been negotiating to get tests inspected and uh - to get an agreement for many, many months.
As a matter of fact, there's been a moratorium on testing as a result of the fact that we have been negotiating.
I've reached the conclusion that the Soviet Union is actually filibustering.
I've reached the conclusion, too, based on the reports that have been made, that they may be cheating.
I don't think we can wait until the next president is inaugurated and then uh - select a new team and then all the months of negotiating that will take place before we reach a decision, I think that immediately after this election we should set a timetable - the next president, working with the present President, President Eisenhower - a timetable to break the Soviet filibuster.
There should be no tests in the atmosphere; that rules out any fall-out.
But as far as underground tests for developing peaceful uses of atomic energy, we should not allow this Soviet filibuster to continue.
I think it's time for them to fish or cut bait.
I think that the next president immediately after his election should sit down with the President, work out a timetable, and - get a decision on this before January of next year.
Our second round of questions begins with one from Mr. Edwards for the Vice President.
Mr. Nixon, carrying forward this business about a timetable; as you know, the pressures are increasing for a summit conference.
Now, both you and Senator Kennedy have said that there are certain conditions which must be met before you would meet with Khrushchev.
Will you be more specific about these conditions?
Well the conditions I laid out in one of our previous television debates, and it's rather difficult to be much more specific than that.
Uh - First of all, we have to have adequate preparation for a summit conference.
This means at the secretary of state level and at the ambassadorial level.
By adequate preparation I mean that at that level we must prepare an agenda, an agenda agreed upon with the approval of the heads of state involved.
Now this agenda should delineate those issues on which there is a possibility of some agreement or negotiation.
I don't believe we should go to a summit conference unless we have such an agenda, unless we have some reasonable insur- assurance from Mr. Khrushchev that he intends seriously to negotiate on those points.
Now this may seem like a rigid, inflexible position.
But let's look at the other side of the coin.
If we build up the hopes of the world by having a summit conference that is not adequately prepared, and then, if Mr. Khrushchev finds some excuse for breaking it up - as he did this one - because he isn't going to get his way - we'd set back the cause of peace.
We do not help it.
We can, in other words, negotiate many of these items of difference between us without going to the summit.
I think we have to make a greater effort than we have been making at the secretary of state level, at the ambassadorial level, to work out the differences that we have.
And so far as the summit conference is concerned, it should only be entered in upon, it should only be agreed upon, if the negotiations have reached the point that we have some reasonable assurance that something is going to come out of it, other than some phony spirit - a spirit of Geneva, or Camp David, or whatever it is.
When I say "phony spirit," I mean phony, not because the spirit is not good on our side, but because the Soviet Union simply doesn't intend to carry out what they say.
Now, these are the conditions that I can lay out.
I cannot be more precise than that, because until we see what Mr. Khrushchev does and what he says uh - we cannot indicate what our plans will be.
Any comments, Senator Kennedy?
Well, I think the president of the United States last winter indicated that before he'd go to the summit in May he did last fall, he indicated that there should be some agenda, that there should be some prior agreement.
He hoped that there would be uh - b- be an agreement in part in disarmament.
He also expressed the hope that there should be some understanding of the general situation in Berlin.
The Soviet Union refused to agree to that, and we went to the summit and it was disastrous.
I believe we should not go to the summit until there is some reason to believe that a meeting of minds can be obtained on either Berlin, outer space, or general disarmament - including nuclear testing.
In addition, I believe the next president in January and February should go to work in building the strength of the United States.
The Soviet Union does understand strength.
We arm to parley, Winston Churchill said ten years ago.
If we are strong, particularly as we face a crisis over Berlin - which we may in the spring, or in the winter - it's important that we maintain our determination here; that we indicate that we're building our strength; that we are determined to protect our position; that we're determined to protect our commitment.
And then I believe we should indicate our desire to live at peace with the world.
But until we're strong here, until we're moving here, I believe a summit could not be successful.
I hope that before we do meet, there will be preliminary agreements on those four questions, or at least two of them, or even one of them, which would warrant such a meeting.
I think if we had stuck by that position last winter, we would have been in a better position in May.
We have time for only one or two more questions before the closing statements.
Now Walter Cronkite's question for Senator Kennedy.
Senator, the charge has been made frequently that the United States for many years has been on the defensive around the world, that our policy has been uh - one of reaction to the Soviet Union rather than positive action on our own.
What areas do you see where the United States might take the offensive in a challenge to Communism over the next four to eight years?
One of the areas, and of course the most vulnerable area is - I have felt, has been Eastern Europe.
I've been critical of the Administration's failure to suggest policies which would make it possible for us to establish, for example, closer relations with Poland, particularly after the fifty-five-fifty-six period and the Hungarian revolution.
We indicated at that time that we were not going to intervene militarily.
