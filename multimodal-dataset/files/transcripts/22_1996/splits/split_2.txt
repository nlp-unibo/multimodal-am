effective deployment of our military resources.
Senator Dole.
Well I failed to mention North Korea and Cuba, a while ago.
You look at North Korea where they have enough plutonium to build six nuclear bombs.
We've sort of distanced ourselves from our ally, South Korea.
They lost about a million people in the war, the Korean War, the forgotten war.
We lost 53,000 Americans.
We shouldn't be doing any favors for North Korea.
It's a closed society.
We don't have any inspection.
We don't know whether it's going to work or not, but we keep giving the incentives.
Someone called them something else.
Incentives.
We don't know what's going to happen.
Here we have Cuba 90 miles from our shores, and what have we done, we passed the law that gave people a right to sue and the President postponed it for six months.
And it seemed to me if you want to send a signal, you've got to send a signal, Mr. President.
The sooner the better off we'll be, if you put tougher sanctions on Castro, not try to make it easier for him.
Mr. President, what is your attitude toward Cuba and how Cuba should be treated?
Well, first of all, for the last four years we have worked had to put more and more pressure on the Castro government to bring about more openness and move toward democracy.
In 1992, before I became President, the Congress passed the Cuba Democracy Act and I enforced it vigorously.
We made the embargo tougher but we increased contacts people to people with the Cubans, including direct telephone service, which was largely supported by the Cuban-American community.
Then Cuba shot down two of our planes and murdered four people in international air space.
They were completely beyond the pale of the law, and I signed the Helms-Burton legislation.
Senator Dole is correct.
I did give about six months before the effective date of the act before lawsuits can actually be filed, even though they're effective now, and can be legally binding, because I want to change Cuba.
And the United States needs help from other countries.
Nobody in the world agrees with our policy on Cuba now.
But this law can be used as leverage to get other countries to help us to move Cuba to democracy.
Every single country in Latin America, Central America and the Caribbean is a democracy tonight but Cuba.
And if we stay firm and strong, we will be able to bring Cuba around as well.
That's the point I made.
We have to be firm and strong.
And I hope that will happen.
It will happen starting next January and maybe it can happen the balance of this year.
We have not been firm and strong.
You look at the poor people who still live in Cuba.
It's a haven for drug smugglers and we don't have a firm policy when it comes to Fidel Castro.
In my view, the policy has failed.
So Congress passes the law, the President signs it, like he does a lot of things.
But he, like welfare reform, I'm going to sign it but I'm going to try to change it next year.
A lot of these election-year conversions, the President talks about the drug money, and all the other things, all this antismoking campaign all happened in 1996.
And I think the people viewing out there ought to go back and take a look at the record when he fought a balanced budget amendment.
When he gave you that biggest tax increase in history; when he tried to take over your healthcare system.
When he fought regulatory reform that cost the average family 6 to $7,000 a year.
This is a serious business.
It's about your family; it's about your business, and in this case it's about a firmer policy with Cuba.
There were several off-the-subject quaffers in that litany.
Let me just mention, Senator Dole voted for $900 billion in tax increases.
His running mate Jack Kemp once said that Bob Dole never met a tax he didn't hike.
And everybody knows, including the Wall Street Journal, hardly a friend of the Democratic party of this administration, that the '82 tax increase he sponsored in inflation-adjusted dollars was the biggest tax increase in American history.
So we ought to at least get the facts out here on the table so we can know where to go from here.
Senator Dole, you mentioned health reform several times.
What do you think should be done about the healthcare system?
Let me first answer that question about the 1982 tax cut.
We were closing loopholes, we were going after big corporations.
I know you probably would oppose it, Mr. President, but I think we should have a fairer system and a flatter system, and we'll have a fairer and flatter system and we're going to make the economic package work.
Healthcare.
Well, we finally passed the Kassebaum bill.
The President was opposed to it in 1993.
He wanted to give us this big system, that took over about one-seventh of the economy, that put on price controls, created all these state alliances, and would cost $1.5 trillion and force people into managed care, whether they wanted it or not.
Most people want to see their own doctor.
They're going to see their own doctor when Bob Dole is president.
We won't threaten anybody.
So we passed the Kassebaum-Kennedy, the Kennedy Kassebaum bill that will cover about 20 to 25 million people.
We've been for that for four, five, six years.
The President held it up.
And even when it finally got near passage, Senator Kennedy held it up for 100 days, because he wasn't satisfied with one provision.
But it will cover preexisting conditions.
If you change your job, you're going to be covered.
So there are a lot of good things in this bill we should have done instead of trying this massive, massive takeover by the Federal government.
But then of course we had a Democratic Congress and they didn't want to do that.
Until we got a Republican Congress, we finally got action, I'm proud of my colleagues in the Republican Party for getting that done.
It means a lot to a lot of people watching us tonight.
Well, that sounds very good, but it's very wrong.
Senator Dole remembers well that we actually offered not to even put in a healthcare bill in 1994, uh '93, but instead to work with the Senate Republicans and write a joint bill.
And they said no because they got a memo from one of their political advisers saying that instead they should characterize whatever we did as big government and make sure nothing was done to aid healthcare before the '94 elections so they could make that claim.
Well, maybe we bit off more than we could chew, but we're pursuing a step-by-step reform now.
The Kennedy-Kassebaum bill that I signed will make it possible for 25 million people to keep their health insurance when they change jobs or when somebody in their family's been sick.
I signed a bill to stop these drive-by deliveries when insurance companies can force people out of the hospital after 24 hours and I vetoed Senator Dole's Medicare plan that would have forced a lot of seniors into managed care and taken a lot more money out of their pockets and led to Medicare withering on the vine.
Well, many of the provisions in the Kassebaum bill were provisions that -- my provisions, like deductions for long-term care, making certain that self-employed people that are watching tonight can deduct not 30 percent but 80 percent of you pay for premiums.
You can also deduct long-term care now, so it's a good it's a good start.
I think there's enough -- we're even looking at our tax cut proposal, our economic package.
There may be a way of reaching out to the uninsured, because there are a lot of uninsured people in the country, particularly children, that should be covered.
Another way you can do is to expand Medicaid.
In America no one will go without healthcare, no one will go without food.
Senator, go ahead and finish your sentence.
All right.
Food.
Back to foreign affairs for a moment, Mr. President.
Are you satisfied with the way you handled this last Iraq crisis and the end result?
Well, I believe that we did the appropriate thing under the circumstances.
Saddam Hussein is under a U.N. resolution not to threaten his neighbors or threaten his own, repress his own citizens.
Unfortunately, a lot of people, have never been as concerned about the Kurds as the United States has tried to be, and we've been flying an operation to protect them out of Turkey for many years now.
What happened was one of the Turkish, one of the Kurdish leaders invited him to go up north, but we felt since the whole world community had told him not to do it, that once he did it we had to do something.
We did not feel that I could commit.
I certainly didn't feel I should commit American troops to throw him out of where he had gone, and that was the only way to do that.
So the appropriate thing strategically to do was to reduce his ability to threaten his neighbors.
We did that by expanding what's called the no-fly zone by increasing our allies' control of the air space now from the Kuwait border to the suburbs of Baghdad.
Was it the right thing to do?
I believe it was.
Is it fully effective?
Did it make him withdraw from the north?
Well, he does , he has a little bit, and I hope he will continue.
We have learned that you give him an inch he'll take a mile.
We had to do something, and even though not all of our allies supported it at first, I think most of them now believe that what we did was an appropriate thing to do.
Senator Dole.
Well, the president's own CIA director says Saddam is stronger now than he was.
I don't understand extending the no-fly zone in the south when the trouble was in the north.
And what we've done during the Bush administration, the Kurds were at the State Department, negotiating, trying to work their differences out.
Now we've got all thousands and thousands of refugees.
We're even shipping 3,000 Kurds to Guam.
It involves Turkey.
It's a real problem.
Saddam is probably about as strong as he ever was.
We shot, what, 44 cruise missiles, worth about a million-two a piece, and hit some radar, that repaired in a couple, three days.
Did we inflict any damage?
No.
Did we have any allies helping?
Well, we have Great Britain.
They're always very loyal to us, and I appreciate that.
And of course Kuwait.
Even though they had to find out they had 5,000 troops coming, they didn't even understand that.
We had to get their permission.
The bottom line is, we went in there alone.
We are supposed to be operating under a U.N. resolution.
We did it without any of our allies that helped in the Gulf.
Senator Dole has two or three times before tonight criticized me for working with the U.N. Now I'm being criticized for not working with the U.N.
It's not the U.N.
Sometimes the United States has to act alone or at least has to act first.
Sometimes we cannot let other countries have a veto on our foreign policy.
I could not send soldiers into the north of Iraq, that would have been wrong.
It could reduce Saddam Hussein's abilities to threaten Kuwait and his other neighbors again.
That's what I did.
I still believe it was the right thing to do.
Senator Dole, on your photo-op foreign policy charge against the President --
Not mine.
Oh, No, no.
I mean your charge against the President, that he has a photo-op foreign policy.
Does the Middle East summit last week fall into that category?
Well, there were some good pictures, but does it fall into that category?
I don't know.
I want to be very serious.
I've supported the President when I thought he was right on Bosnia.
I supported him on NAFTA and GATT.
So it's not that we always disagree.
Others disagreed with us.
The Mideast is very difficult.
But it seemed to me just as an observer that you know before you'd call somebody to America, you'd have some notion what the end result might be.
Now maybe it's better just to get together and sit down and talk.
Maybe that was the purpose.
And I know talks have started again today.
But again it's almost like an ad hoc foreign policy.
It's ad hoc, it's sort of we get up in the morning and read the papers, what country's in trouble, we'll have a meeting.
Now, to me that's not the strategy that I think people expect from America.
I think we have lost credibility, and I say this very honestly without any partisanship.
We've lost credibility around the world.
Our allies know, -- they're not certain what we're going to do, what our reaction, what our response is going to be.
Nobody suggested sending troops to Iraq, if that was the hint there from the President.
But I do think that Saddam Hussein is stronger than he was.
And I do believe that we didn't gain a great deal in the Mideast by bringing three of the four leaders, one refused to come, to Washington D.C.
We have a very consistent policy in the Middle East: It is to support the peace process; to support the security of Israel; and to support those who are prepared to take risks for peace.
It is a very difficult environment.
The feelings are very strong.
There are extremists in all parts of the Middle East who want to kill that peace process.
Prime Minister Rabin gave his life because someone in his own country literally hated him for trying to bring peace.
I would like to have had a big, organized summit, but those people were killing each other, rapidly, innocent Arab children, innocent Israeli people, they were dying.
And there is ,so much trust has broken down in the aftermath of the change of government.
I felt that if I could just get the parties together to say let's stop the violence, start talking, commit to the negotiations, that would be a plus.
Now today the Secretary of State is in the Middle East and they've started negotiations and all those leaders promised me they would not quit until they resolved the issues between them and got the peace process going forward again.
Senator Dole.
Well, I was disappointed.
The President has not called for an unconditional end to the violence.
It seemed to me the violence stopped when these leaders came to America.
The killing and tragedies had taken place.
And it is unfortunate, it is a difficult area, no doubt about it.
It shouldn't be politicized in any way by the President or by his opponent.
And I don't intend to politicize it.
I hope they talked and I hope they've reached some result and that the killing will end.
Thank you.
Mr. President, in your acceptance speech in Chicago, you said the real choice in this race is, quote, whether we build a bridge to the future or a bridge to the past; about whether we believe our best days are still out there or our best days are behind us; about whether we want a country of people all working together or one where you're on your own, end quote.
Are you saying that you believe Senator Dole is a man of the past and if elected president he would lead the country backward?
Well, I'm saying that Senator Dole said in his fine speech in San Diego that he wanted to build a bridge to the past.
And I think I know what he meant by that.
He's troubled, as I am, by some of the things that go on today.
But I believe America is the greatest country in human history because we have maintained freedom and increasing prosperity by relentlessly pushing the barriers of knowledge, the barriers of the present, always moving into the future.
That's why when I became President I was determined to kind of move beyond this whole stale debate that had gone on in Washington for too long to get this country moving again.
And that's why we've got a country with ten and a half million more jobs, and record numbers of new businesses, and rising incomes, and falling crime rates, and welfare roll rates.
That's why we're moving in the right direction.
And I'm trying to emphasize that what I want to do is to continue to do that.
That's why my balanced budget plan will still invest and grow this economy.
That's why I want a tax cut for education and child rearing, but it's got to be paid for.
That's why I want to continue the work we have done over partisan opposition, to work with communities to bring that crime rate down until our streets are all safe again.
These are my commitments.
I am very oriented toward the future.
I think this election has to be geared toward the future.
I think America's best days are still ahead, but we've got to build the right bridge.
Senator Dole.
You know, the President reminds me sometimes of my brother Kenny, who is no longer alive.
But Kenny was a great talker.
And he used to tell me things that I knew were not quite accurate.
So we always had a rule, we divided by six.
Maybe in your case maybe just two.
But 11 million new jobs and everything, I mean the President can't take credit for everything that governors are doing, whether that's happening in New York City when it comes to the murder rate and then not be responsible for the bad things that happen, whether it's drug use or something else in America.
So it seems to me that we can talk about what we call Kenny, the great exaggerator.
He just liked to make it sound exager, a little better, made him feel better.
When it comes to bridges, I want a bridge to the future.
I also want a bridge to the truth.
We have to tell the truth.
We've got people watching tonight and listening tonight trying to find the truth.
And the truth is, there is a lot wrong with America.
We need a strong economic package; we need a tax cut; we need the $500 child credit, and we'll have that soon.
Mr. President.
I do not for a moment think I'm entitled to all the credit for all the good things that have happened in America.
But where I have moved to work with the American people to help them have the tools to make the most of their own lives, I think I should get some credit for that.
I also personally took responsibility tonight when Senator Dole asked me about the drug problem.
But, you know, I think my ideas are better for the future.
Senator Dole voted against student loans, against Headstart, against creating the Department of Education.
If he gets elected president, we'll start the new century without anyone in the cabinet of the President representing education in our children.
I personally don't think that's the right kind of future for America, and I think we ought to take a different tack.
Senator Dole, do you still favor eliminating the Department of Education.
Yes.
I didn't favor it when it was in, started.
I voted against it.
It was a tribute after President Carter's election to the National Education Association who send a lot of delegates to the Democratic convention, who gives 99.5 percent of their money, Democrat Democrats, and the President, and a lot of the teachers send their kids to private schools or better public schools.
So what we want to do is called opportunity scholarships.
Now, some say, oh, you're a Republican, you can't be reaching out to these people.
I've reached out to people all my life.
I've worked on the food stamp program, proudly.
And the WIC program, and the school lunch program with senators like George McGovern, Hubert Humphrey and others, to name a few of my Democratic friends.
I'm not some extremist out here.
I care about people.
I have my own little foundation that's raised about $10 million for the disabled.
I don't advertise it.
Just did, haven't before.
And I try to do a lot of things that I think might be helpful to people.
So it seems to me that we ought to take that money we can save from the Department of Education, put it into opportunity scholarships and tell little Landale Shakespeare out in Cleveland, Ohio, and tell your mother and father, you're going to get to go to school because we're going to match what the state puts up, and you're going to go to the school of your choice.
I don't fault the President or the vice president for sending their children to private schools or better schools.
I applaud them for it, I don't criticize them.
But why shouldn't everybody have that choice.
Why shouldn't low income Americans and low middle income Americans.
I'm excited about it.
It's going to be a big, big opportunity for a lot of people.
Let me say first of all, I'm all for students having more choices.
We've worked hard to expand public school choice in my balanced budget bill.
There's funds for 3,000 new schools created by teachers and parents, sometimes by business people, called charter schools that have no rules, they're free of bureaucracy and can only stay in existence if they perform and teach children.
The ones that are out there are doing well.
What I'm against is Senator Dole's plan to take money away from all the children we now help with limited Federal funds and help far fewer.
If we're going to have a private voucher plan, that ought to be done at the local level or the state level.
But Senator Dole has consistently opposed Federal help to education.
He voted against student loans; he voted against my improved student loan plan; he voted against the National Service bill, against the HeadStart bill; he voted against our efforts in safe and drug-free schools.
He voted against these programs, he does not believe it.
That's the issue.
90 percent of our kids are out there in those public schools and we need to lift their standards and move them forward with the programs like those I've outlined in this campaign.
I'd better correct the President.
I don't know what time it is, but it's probably getting late.
I want to correct, the all these things I voted against, they were probably part of some big package that had a lot of pork in it or a lot of things that we shouldn't have had and we probably voted no.
I've supported all the education programs.
I've supported Headstart, I think we ought to look at it.
So I don't want anybody out there to think we've just been voting no, no, no.
Let's give low income parents the same right that people of power and prestige have in America and let them go to better schools.
Let's not, let's help, let's turn the schools back to the teachers and back to the parents and take it away from the National Education Association.
Mr. President, what is wrong with the school choice proposal?
I support school choice.
I support school choice.
I have advocated expansions of public school choice alternatives and I said the creation of 3,000 new schools that we are going to help the states to finance.
But if you're going to have a private voucher plan, that ought to be determined by states in localities where they're raising and spending most of the money.
I simply think it's wrong to take money away from programs that are helping build basic skills for kids, 90 percent of them are in the public schools; to take money away from programs that are helping fund the school lunch program, that are helping to fund the other programs, that are helping our schools to improve their standards.
Our schools are getting better, and our schools can be made to be even better still with the right kind of community leadership and partnership at the school level.
I have been a strong force for reform.
And, Senator, I remind you that a few years ago when I supported teacher testing while in my home state I was pretty well lambasted by the teachers association.
I just don't believe we ought to be out there running down teachers and attacking them the way you did at the Republican convention.
I think we ought to be lifting them up and moving our children forward.
And let me just say that budget that you passed that I vetoed would have cut 50,000 kids out of Headstart.
It would have eliminated the AmeriCorps plan and it would have cut back on student loans and scholarships.
Now, it would have.
That's a fact.
That's one of the big reasons
