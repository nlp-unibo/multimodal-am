recover but we're going to eliminate frivolous lawsuits, I'll sign the bill.
But generally I believe that a president has to be willing to do what he thinks is right.
I've done a lot of things that were controversial.
My economic plan, my trade position, Bosnia, Haiti, taking on the NRA for the first time, taking on the tobacco companies for the first time.
Sometimes you just have to do that because you know it's right for the country over the long run.
That's what I've tried to do and that's what I will continue to do as president.
Senator Dole.
How does he avoid conflict?
Well, I don't know in the case of the trial lawyers.
I look at the trial lawyers, and when you're a few million short, you run out to Hollywood and pick up two to four million and organized labor comes to Washington, D.C. and puts 35 million into the pot.
Now, if these aren't special interests, I've got a lot to learn.
I was there for a while before I left on June the 11th.
The trial lawyers and I don't -- you know, my wife's a lawyer.
We're the only two lawyers in Washington that trust each other.
But we're lawyers, I like lawyers.
I don't dislike trial lawyers.
But it seemed to me there's got to be some end to the frivolous lawsuits and there's got to be some cap on punitive damage.
You're putting a lot of business people out of business.
Small businessmen and businesswomen who paid 70 percent of your ninteen , your$265 billion tax increase, the largest tax increase in the history of America.
I said that one day and Pat Moynihan, a Democrat, say, no, he said, in the history of the world.
So I modified it, the largest tax increase in the history of the world.
And it seems to me that there is a problem there, Mr. President.
And I will address you as Mr. President.
You didn't do that with Mr. with President Bush in 1992.
Mr. President.
Let me say, first of all, I signed a tort reform bill that dealt with civilian aviation a couple of years ago.
I proved that I will sign reasonable tort reform.
Secondly, Senator Dole had some pretty harsh comments about special interest money, but it wasn't me who opposed what we tried to do to save the lives of children who were subject to tobacco and then went to the tobacco growers and bragged about standing up for the Federal government when we tried to stop the advertising, marketing, and sales of tobacco to children.
And it wasn't me that let the polluters actually come into the halls of Congress, into the rooms, and rewrite the environmental laws.
That's what Speaker Gingrich and Senator Dole did, not me.
That's not true.
So I believe that we should take a different approach to this and talk about how we stand on the issues instead of trying to characterize each other's motivations.
I think Senator Dole and I just honestly disagree.
Well, Senator Dole, let me ask you the same question I asked the President: How do you avoid being influenced by people who contribute money and services to your campaigns?
I think it's very difficult.
Let's be honest about it.
That's why we need campaign finance reform.
That's why I reach out to the Perot voters.
We've done about all, we are the reform party, the Republican Party.
And the Perot voters that are looking for a home ought to take a look at the Republican record.
Whatever it is, whatever the checklist was in '92, it's all done with campaign finance reform.
I worked with Senator Mitchell, who played me, I guess, in the debate warmup.
We tried six or eight years ago.
He appointed three people, I appointed three people to get campaign finance reform.
We couldn't get it done, because I wasn't enforceable.
You've suggested a commission, Newt Gingrich did, I suggested that at least four or five years ago.
We have a commission on campaign finance reform.
They send it to Congress, and we have to vote it up or down.
That's how it works.
We are never going to fix it by the parties, because Democrats want a better advantage for themselves, we want a better advantage as Republicans, and that's not how it's going to work.
But I want to touch on this is tobacco thing.
I know the President's been puffing a lot on that.
But I want to go back to 1965.
That was my first vote against tobacco companies when I said we ought to label cigarettes.
And I've had a consistent record ever since 1965.
We passed a bill in 1992 that encouraged the states to adopt programs to stop kids from smoking.
All 50 states did it.
It took three and a half years.
It wasn't until election year, Mr. President, that you ever thought about stopping smoking.
What about drugs that have increased, doubled in the last 44 months?
Cocaine is up 141 percent -- marijuana, cocaine up 166 percent.
It seems to me that you have a selective memory.
You know, mine doesn't work that way.
So I just want to try to correct it as we go along.
Mr. Lehrer, I hope we'll have a chance to discuss drugs later in the program.
But let me respond to what you said.
I agree that too many incumbent politicians in Washington in both parties have consistently opposed campaign finance reform.
That was certainly the case from the minute I got there.
So after Speaker Gingrich and Senator Dole took over the Congress, I went to New Hampshire and a man suggested -- a gentleman that unfortunately just passed away a couple of days ago, suggested that we appoint a commission.
And I shook hands with him on it and I appointed my members, and the commission never met.
And then Senator Dole's ardent supporters, Senator McCain, who's out there today, along with Senator Feingold, supported, sponsored a campaign finance reform proposal.
I strongly supported it.
And members of Senator Dole's own party in the Senate killed it.
And he was not out there urging them to vote for the McCain-Feingold bill.
So I think the American people, including the Perot supporters, know that I have had a consistent record in favor of campaign finance reform, and I will continue to have.
And I hope we can finally get it in the next session of Congress, because we need it badly.
Senator Dole, 30 seconds.
Well, on campaign reform itself, we're going to get it when we have a bipartisan commission, take it out of politics.
Get people who don't have any interest in politics but understand the issue and let them make the recommendation to Congress.
Now, we're now kidding anybody, Mr. President.
These are sophisticated people watching tonight.
Millions and millions of Americans.
They know the Republican Party hasn't done it.
They know the Democratic party won't do it.
We ought to agree that somebody else should do it.
And we have to vote it up or down, Mr. President.
Mr. President, the Senator mentioned drugs.
He suggested that you are -- you bear some responsibility for the rise in drug use of teenagers in the United States.
Is he right?
Well, Jim, I think every American in any position of responsibility should be concerned about what's happened.
I am.
But let's look at the overall record.
Overall in America cocaine use has dropped 30 percent in the last four years, casual drug use down 13 percent.
The tragedy is that our young people are still increasing their use of drugs up to about 11 percent total with marijuana, and I regret it.
Let me tell you what I tried to do about it.
I appointed a four-star general who led our efforts south of the border to keep drugs from coming into the country as our nation's drug czar.
The most heavily directed, decorated solder in uniform when he retired.
We submitted the biggest drug budget ever.
We have dramatically increased control and enforcement at the border.
We supported a a crime bill that had 60 death penalties including, including the death penalty for drug kingpins.
And I supported a big expansion in safe and drug-free schools program to support things like the DARE program because I thought all those things were very important.
Do I think that I bear some responsibility for the fact that too many of our children still don't understand drugs are wrong, drugs can kill you.
Even though I have consistently opposed the legalization of drugs all my public life and worked hard against them.
I think we all do.
And I hope we can do better.
I don't think this issue should be politicized because my record is clear and I don't think Senator Dole supports using using drugs.
I think we just have to continue to work on this until those who think it isn't dangerous and won't kill them and won't destroy their lives, get the message and change.
Senator.
Again, well it's, you are very selective, Mr. President.
You don't want to politicize drugs, but it's already politicized Medicare, go out and scare senior citizens and other vulnerable groups, veterans and people who get Pell Grants and things like this.
I mean, you say we've done all these bad things, which isn't the case.
But it seems to me the record is clear.
The record is pretty clear in Arkansas, when you were governor.
Drug use doubled.
You resisted the appointment of a drug czar there because you thought it might interfere with treatment.
But here you cut the drug czar's office 83 percent.
You cut interdiction substantially.
I mean that's what, I want to stop it from coming across the border.
And in my administration, we're going to train the National Guard to stop it from coming across the border.
This is a invasion of drugs from all over the world.
And we have a responsibility.
You had a surgeon -- or before General McCaffrey (ph) you had a lady who said we ought to consider legalizing drugs.
Is that the kind of leadership we need?
And I won't comment on other things that happened in your administration or your past about drugs.
But it seems to me the kids ought to -- if they've started, they ought to stop and just don't do it.
Mr. President.
Let me say again, we did have a drug czar in Arkansas, but he answered to the governor, just like this one answers to the President.
That's what I thought we ought to do.
Secondly, Senator Dole, you voted against the crime bill that had the death penalty for drug kingpins in it.
And you voted to cut services to 23 million school children under the safe and drug-free schools act.
I don't think that means you're soft on drugs.
We just have a different approach.
But let me remind you, my family has suffered from drug abuse.
I know what it's like to see somebody you love nearly lose their lives, and I hate drugs, Senator.
We need to do this together and we can.
Senator Dole, on the government, continuing to talk about the government's role.
If elected President, would you seek to repeal the Brady Bill and the ban on assault weapons?
Not if I didn't have a better idea.
But I've got a better idea.
It's something I've worked on for 15 years.
It's called the automated check or the instant check.
It's being used in 17 states right now.
States like Florida, Colorado, Virginia, and other states.
You don't buy any gun.
You don't get any gun.
We've got 20 million names on a computer in Washington, D.C. of people who should not have guns.
We ought to keep guns out of the hands of criminals.
And, there are eight other categories that should not have guns.
I've been working on this for a long, long time.
You walk in, you put your little card in there.
If it says tilt, you don't get any gun.
You don't get a hand gun, you don't get a rifle, you don't get a shot gun, you get zippo.
If we're going to protect American children and American families and people who live as prisoners in their own home, we've got to stop guns from being dumped on the street.
The administration says they support the instant check.
They've appropriated about $200 million, but only spent about $3 million to get it underway.
In our administration, in my administration, we will expedite.
This keeps up with technology.
It keeps guns out of the hands of people who should not have guns.
That is the bottom line.
And I believe it's a good idea, has strong bipartisan support.
And perhaps that's another thing we can depoliticize.
You talk about the Brady Bill.
There has only been one prosecution under the Brady -- only one under the assault weapon ban and only seven under the Brady Bill that you talk about all the time.
And on the assault weapon ban, out of 17 weapons that were banned, only six banned now because eleven have been modified and are back on the street.
Let's get together on this instant check because that will really make a difference.
Mr. President.
Let me say, first of all, Senator Dole has gone back and forth about whether he'd be for repealing the Brady Bill or repealing the assault weapons ban.
And I think his present position is he would not do so, and if that's true I'm grateful for it.
But let's look at the facts here.
The Brady Bill has kept at least 60,000 felons, fugitives and stalkers from getting hand guns.
Senator Dole led the fight against the Brady Bill.
He tried to keep it from coming to my desk.
He didn't succeed and I signed it and I'm glad I did.
Then when we had the assault weapons ban in the Senate, Senator Dole fought it bitterly and opposed the entire crime bill and almost brought the entire crime bill down because the National Rifle Association didn't want the assault weapons ban, just like they didn't want the Brady Bill.
But two years later nobody's lost their handguns.
I mean, their rifles.
We've expanded the Brady Bill to cover people who beat up their spouses and their kids.
And this is a safer country.
So I'm glad I took on that fight and I believe, with all respect, I was right and he was wrong.
Well, the President doesn't have it quite right.
I mean, it seemed to me at the time the assault weapon ban was not effective.
But that's history.
I told the NRA that's history.
You're not going to worry about it anymore.
I'm not going to worry about it anymore.
Let's do something better.
Let's stop, you know, playing the political game, Mr. President.
Talking about this and this.
You add all the states that've used the instant check and how many weapons they keep, kept out of the hands of criminals.
It would far surpass the numbers you mentioned.
So in my view, if you want to be protected, you ought to vote for Bob Dole and we'll get the instant check passed and we'll keep guns out of the hands of criminals.
Mr. President, Senator Dole said the other day that you practiced a photo-op foreign policy that has lessened the credibility of the United States throughout the world.
Is he wrong about that?
If he, that's what he said, he's not right about that.
Look at where we are today.
The United States is still the indispensable nation in the aftermath of the Cold War and on the brink of the 21st Century.
I have worked to support our country as the world's strongest force for peace and freedom, prosperity and security.
We have done the following things: Number one, we've managed the aftermath of the Cold War, supporting a big drop in nuclear weapons in Russia.
The removal of Russian troops from the Baltics.
The integration of Central and Eastern European democracies into a new partnership with NATO.
And, I might add, with the democratic Russia.
There are no nuclear missiles pointed at the children of the United States tonight and have not been in our administration for the first time since the dawn of the nuclear age.
We have worked hard for peace and freedom.
When I took office, Haiti was governed by a dictator that had defied the United States.
When I took office, the worst war in Europe was waging in Bosnia.
Now there is a the democratically elected president in Haiti.
Peace in Bosnia.
We just had the election there.
We've made progress in Northern Ireland, in the Middle East.
We've also stood up to the new threats of terrorism.
The proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, organized crime, and we have worked hard to expand America's economic presence around the world with the biggest increase in trade with the largest new number of trade agreements in history And that's one of the reasons America is number one in auto production again.
Senator.
Well, I have a different view.
Again, Iâ€™ve supported the President on Bosnia, and I think we were told the troops would be out in a year.
Now I understand it's been extended 'til some time next year.
But, let's start with Somalia, where they dragged Americans through the streets, and where 18 Americans were killed one day, because they didn't have, they were pinned down for eight hours, the rangers.
They didn't have the weapons, they didn't have the tanks.
They asked for the tanks.
They didn't get the tanks from this administration because we were nation building.
It's called mission creep.
We turn it over to the United Nations.
The President didn't have much to do about it.
You look at Haiti, where we spend about three billion dollars and we got an alarm call there about two weeks ago.
You got to send down some more people, because the president's found out there are death squads on his on his, in his own property.
So we need more protection from America.
Bosnia, Northern Ireland.
There's no ceasefire in Bosnia.
I think there are still lot of problems in Bosnia.
We agreed to train and arm the Muslims so they could defend themselves, the policy you had when you ran in 1992.
We haven't done that.
We're way behind, which means Americans can't come home.
Americans shouldn't have gone there in the first place, had we let them defend themselves, as they have a right to do under Article 57 of the United Nations charter.
Mr. President.
First of all, I take full responsibility for what happened in Somalia, but the American people must remember that those soldiers were under an American commander when that happened.
I believe they did the best they could under the circumstances, and let's not forget that hundreds of thousands of lives were saved there.
Secondly, in Haiti, political violence is much, much smaller than it was.
Thirdly, in Bosnia it's a virtual miracle that there has been no return to war and at least there has now been an election.
And institutions are beginning to function.
In Northern Ireland, in the Middle East we are better off than we were four years ago.
There will always be problems in this whole world.
But if we're moving in the right direction and America is leading, we're better off.
Senator Dole, if elected president, what criteria would you use to decide when to send U.S. troops into harm's way.
Well it, after World War I, we had, you know, a policy of disengagement.
Then from World War I to World War II we had sort of a compulsory engagement policy.
Now I think we have a selective engagement policy.
We have to determine when our interests are involved, not the United Nations' interests.
And many of the things the President talked about, he turned over to the United Nations.
They decided.
He's deployed more troops than any president in history around the world.
It's cost us billions and billions of dollars for peace-keeping operations.
Look these are facts.
And it seems to me that when you make a decision, the decision is made by the President of the United States, by the Commander-in-Chief.
He makes that decision when he commits young men or young women who are going to go round and defend our liberty and our freedom.
That would be my position.
Then I'm going to have a top down review at the Pentagon, not a bottom up review.
We all fight over how much money is there.
I want a top down review to determine what our priorities are and what we should do in defense, and then follow that policy instead of this bottom up review with all the services fighting for the money.
You know, the President said he was going to cut defense $60 billion, he cut defense $112 billion.
Devastated states like California and others.
And I think now we've got a problem.
We've got to go back and look.
It's just like you said in Texas one day, you know raised taxes too much, and you did, and you cut defense too much, Mr. President, and you did.
You may have said that, too.
But the bottom line is, we are the strongest nation in the world.
We provide the leadership and we're going to have to continue to provide the leadership, but let's do it on our terms when our interests are involved and not when somebody blows the whistle at the United Nations.
Our military is the strongest military in the world.
It is the strongest, best prepared, best equipped it has ever been.
There is very little difference in the budget that I proposed and the Republican budget over the next six-year period.
We are spending a lot of money to modernize our weapons system.
I have proposed a lot of new investments to improve the quality of life for our soldiers, for our men and women in uniform, for their families, for their training.
That is my solemn obligation.
You ask when do you decide to deploy them.
The interests of the American people must be at stake.
Our values must be at stake.
We have to be able to make a difference.
And frankly we have to consider what the risks are to our young men and women in uniform.
But I believe the evidence is that our deployments have been successful, in Haiti, in Bosnia, when we moved to Kuwait to repel Saddam Hussein's threatened invasion of Kuwait.
When I have sent the fleet into the Taiwan straits.
When we've worked hard to end the Northern Korean nuclear threat.
I believe the United States is at peace tonight in part because of the disciplined, careful,
