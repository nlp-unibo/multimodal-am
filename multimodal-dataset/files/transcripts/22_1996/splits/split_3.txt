I vetoed it.
We need to be doing more in education, not less.
Well, the AmeriCorps program, I must say, if that's one of your successes, I wouldn't speak about it too loudly.
It costs about $27,000 to pay people to volunteer.
We've got four million young people volunteering every year, the number hasn't gone down.
And you pick out 20,000, whether they need the money or not, and they get paid for volunteering.
I like young people.
I like teachers.
I'm a product of a public school.
You attended a private school for some time in your life.
I like teachers.
You're not for school choice, you can't be for school choice, because this is that special interest money again.
When you get 99.5 percent of the money, we don't know what happened to the other .5 percent, we're looking for it, somebody got it, but it all went to Democrats.
And this is part of that liberal establishment, one of those liberal things that you just can't do.
You're for school uniforms and curfews and you're opposed to truancy.
Now that's not reform, Mr. President.
Why can't Landale Shakespeare in Cleveland or Pilar Gonzales in Milwaukee give their children an opportunity to go to a better school.
Some schools aren't safe.
Some schools aren't even safe.
Your choice is nothing.
Let's give them a real choice, the kind of choice you had, and the kind of choice a lot of people have in America.
If we want to stop crime and teenage pregnancy, let's start with education.
First of all, Senator Dole, let's set the record straight.
I was able for two years when I was in, a very young boy to go to a Catholic school, but I basically went to public schools all my life.
And I've worked hard for a long time to make them better, 90 percent of our kids are there.
You, it's amazing to me, you are all for having more responsibility at the local level for everything except schools.
Where we don't have very much money at the Federal level to spend on education, we ought to spend it helping the 90 percent of the kids that we can help.
If a local school district in Cleveland or anyplace else wants to have a private choice plan like Milwaukee did, let them have at it.
I might say the results are highly ambiguous.
But I want to get out there and give a better education opportunity to all of our children and that's why I vetoed the budget you passed with $30 billion in education cuts.
It was wrong, and my plan for the future is better.
Senator Dole, at the Republican convention you said the following and I quote, it is demeaning to the nation that within the Clinton Administration a core of the elite who never grew up, never did anything real, never sacrificed, never suffered, and never learned should have the power to fund with your earnings their dubious and self-serving schemes, end quote.
Whom precisely and what precisely did you have in mind?
I had precisely in mind a lot of the people that were in the White House and other agencies who've never been had any experience, who came to Washington without any experience, they all were very liberal, of course, or they wouldn't be in the administration.
And their idea was that they knew what was best for the American people.
Now, I feel very strongly about a lot of things.
I feel strongly about education.
I want to help young people have an education, just as I had an education after World War II with the GI bill of Rights.
We've had millions of young men and women in subsequent subsequent wars change the face of the nation because the government helped with their education.
Now the reason they don't have, The reason the President can't support this is pretty obvious.
It's not taking anything away from schools, it's new money.
It's not being taken away from anybody else, except we'll downsize the Department of Education.
But this is a very liberal administration.
This is an administration that gave you the big tax cut.
This administration tried to take over healthcare and impose a governmental system.
This is the administration that fought regulatory reform that is putting a lot of small businessmen and small businesswomen out of business.
This is the administration that fought the balanced budget amendment and vetoed a balanced budget and vetoed welfare reform twice, and the list goes on and on and on, that's what I had in mind.
I want people in my administration and will have people in my administration who understand America.
There won't be 10 millionaires and 14 lawyers in the cabinet.
There will be people with experience and people who understand America and people who've made it and know the hard knocks in life.
When Senator Dole made that remark about all the elitists, all the young elitists in the administration, one of the young men who works for me who grew up in a house trailer looked at me and said, Mr. President, I know how you grew up, who is he talking about.
And you know this liberal charge, that's what their party always drags out when they get in a tight race.
It's sort of their golden oldie, you know.
It's a record they think they can play that everybody loves to hear.
And I just don't think that dog will hunt this time.
The American people should make up their own mind.
Here's the record: We cut deficit four years in a row for the first time before the Civil War -- I mean, before World War II, and maybe before the Civil War, too.
We've got ten and a half million new jobs; we've got record numbers of those new small businesses.
We've made every one of them eligible for a tax cut.
We've got declining crime rates, two million fewer people on welfare rolls before welfare reform passed, and a 50 percent increase in child support and a crime bill with 60 death penalties and 100,000 police and the assault weapons ban.
The American people can make up their mind about whether that's a liberal record or a record that's good for America.
Liberal, conservative, you put whatever label you want on it.
Well, I think it's pretty liberal, I'll put that label on it.
You take a look at all the programs you've advocated, Mr. President.
Thank goodness we had a Republican Congress there.
The first thing you did when you came into office was set up the stimulus package, said we've got a little pork we want to scatter around America, $16 billion.
And even some in your own party couldn't buy that.
I remember talking by the telephone.
I'm not even certain you were too excited about that.
I won't, I never repeat what I've talked to the President about.
In any event, we saved the taxpayers $16 billion.
And then came some other program, and then came healthcare, and then came the tax increase and a lot of these things stopped in 1994 because then the Congress changed, and I think we've done a good job.
Mr. President, if you're not a liberal, describe your political philosophy.
I believe that the purpose of politics is to give people the tools to make the most of their own lives; to reinforce the values of opportunity and responsibility, and to build a sense of community so we're all working together.
I don't believe in discrimination.
I believe you can protect the environment and grow the economy.
I believe that we have to do these things with a government that's smaller and less bureaucratic, but that we have to do them nonetheless.
It's inconvenient for Senator Dole, but the truth is I've reduced the size of government more than my Republican predecessors.
And I did stop them, I admit that.
I sure stopped their budget.
Their budget cut enforcement for the Environmental Protection Agency by a third.
It cut funds to clean up toxic waste dumps with 10 million of our kids still living within four miles of a toxic waste dump, by a third.
It ended the principle that the polluters should pay for those toxic waste dumps unless it was very recent.
Their budget weakened our support for education.
$30 billion, even cut funds for scholarships and college loans.
Their budget cut $270 billion in Medicare and, finally, their budget withdrew the national guarantee of healthcare to poor children, families with children with handicaps, the elderly in nursing homes, poor pregnant women.
It was wrong for the country and calling it conservative won't make it right.
It was a bad decision for America and would have been bad for our future if I hadn't stopped it.
Well, the President can define himself in any way he wants, but I think we have to look at the record.
Go back to the time he was, what, Texas director for George McGovern.
George McGovern is a friend of mine, so I don't mean, but he was a liberal, proud liberal.
I've just finished reading a book, I think it's called -- what is it called, what is it, The Demise of the Democratic Party by Ronald Cardash (ph) or something talking about all the liberal influences in the administration.
Whether it's organized labor or whether it's the Hollywood elite or whether some of the media elite or whether it's the labor unions or whatever.
And so I think you take a look at it.
The bottom line is this: I think the American people, thought he'd recite all these bills and all these things, they want to know what's going to happen to them.
They've all got a lot of anxieties out there.
Did anybody complain when you raised taxes?
Did anybody go out and ask the people, how are you going to pay the extra money?
That's why we want an economic package.
We want the government to pinch their pennies for a change instead of the people pinching their pennies.
That's what our message is to the people watching.
Not all this back and forth, you voted this way, you voted that way, we want a better America as we go into the next century.
The way you get a better America is to balance the budget and protect Medicare, Medicaid, education and the environment; to give a targeted tax cut -- and let me talk about the education tax cut -- to let people have a $10,000 deduction for the cost of college tuition in any year, any kind of college tuition; to give families a tax credit, a dollar for dollar reduction in their taxes for the cost of a typical community college so we can open that to everybody.
And then to let people save in an IRA and withdraw from it without a tax penalty for education, home buying or medical expenses, that's the right way to go into the 21st Century, balance the budget and cut taxes, not balloon with this $550 billion tax scheme.
Senator Dole, we've talked mostly now about differences between the two of you that relate to policy issues and that sort of thing.
Are there also significant differences in the more personal area that are relevant to this election?
Let me say first, on the President's promise for another tax cut.
I mean, I've told people as I've traveled around, all of you that got the tax cut he promised last time, vote for him in '96 and not many hands go up.
So the question is, would you buy a used election promise from my opponent.
The people want economic reform.
They're having a hard time making ends meet.
You've got one parent working for the government, the other parent working for the family.
This is important business.
This is about getting the economy moving again.
This is about American jobs and opportunities.
It's about the government, as I said before, pinching its pennies for a change instead of the poor taxpayer.
When they raise your taxes nobody runs around asking people where are you going to get the extra money.
I think the government can do better.
Are there personal differences?
That are relevant to this.
Well, my blood pressure is lower, my weight, my cholesterol, but I will not make health an issue in this campaign.
So I think he's a bit taller than I am.
But I think there are personal differences.
I mean, I'm not I don't like to get into personal matters.
As far as I'm concerned, this is a campaign about issues.
It's about my vision for America and about his liberal vision for America.
And not about personal things.
You know, I think his liberal vision is a thing of the past.
I know he wants to disown it.
I wouldn't want to be a liberal either, Mr. President, but you're stuck with it because that's your record, that's your record in Arkansas: The biggest tax increase in history.
The biggest crime increase in history, the biggest drug increase in history in Arkansas.
Mr. President.
Well, just for the record, when I was governor we had the lowest -- second lowest tax burden of any state in the country, the highest job growth rate of any state when I ran for president and were widely recognized for a lot of other advances.
But the important thing is, what are we going to do now.
I think a targeted tax cut is better for our future, targeted to education and child rearing, with the rest of the education plan, hooking up all of our classrooms to the Internet by the year 2000.
Making sure we've got an army of reading volunteers, trained people to teach with parents and teachers so that our eight year olds can learn to read.
Investing in our environment.
Cleaning up two-thirds of the worst toxic waste dumps.
Those plans are better than this $550 billion tax scheme.
Now, remember, folks, even Senator Dole's campaign co-chair here, Senator D'Amato, says he's got to cut Medicare to pay for this.
Everybody who's looked at it, 500 economists, seven Nobel prize winners, say it's bad for the economy.
It's going to blow a hole in the deficit It's going to raise taxes on nine million people and require bigger cuts than the one I vetoed.
Our plan is better, it will take us into the future with a growing economy and healthier families.
Well, I'm really encouraged to know of your renewed friendship with Al D'Amato, and I know he appreciates it.
You didn't even have tax cuts in your budget, Mr. President, the first two years you were president.
It wasn't until we had a Republican Congress you even thought about, you talked about tax cuts.
Getting back to personal differences, I think, Jim, if you are a little more specific, but I think the President could clarify one thing tonight and that's the question of pardons.
I know you talked about it on the Jim, with Jim Lehrer on the PBS show.
And I've never discussed Whitewater, as I've told you personally.
I'm not discussing Whitewater now.
But I am discussing the power the President has to grant pardons.
And hopefully in the next segment you could lay that to rest.
Mr. President.
Well, first of all, you know, he made that remark about Senator D'Amato.
He's arranged for me to spend a lot more time with Senator D'Amato in the last couple years so I'm more familiar with his comments than I used to be.
Let me say what I've said already about this pardon issue.
This is an issue they've brought up.
It's under, there's been no consideration of it, no discussion of it.
I will tell you this: I will not give anyone special treatment and I will strictly adhere to the law.
And that is what every president has done, as far as I know, in the past but what every other president's has done.
This is something I take seriously and that's my position.
But it seems to me the president shouldn't have any comment at all.
Particularly where it's someone where you've had business dealings.
I mean, you may be sending a signal.
I don't know, I'm not questioning anybody.
But as a President of the United States, when somebody asks you about pardons, you say no comment, period.
And I think he made a mistake.
And I think when you make a mistake, you say I made a mistake.
But apparently his position hasn't changed.
If there are other specific areas, but beyond that I haven't gotten into any of these things, as the President knows.
We've had that discussion.
And again I know Senator D'Amato I think may have had a hearing or two on Whitewater, I can't remember, but he's not my general chairman, he's a friend of mine.
And so is Senator Kennedy a friend of yours.
You bet.
I remember one day on the floor I said now, gentlemen, let me tax your memories, and Kennedy jumped up and said, why haven't we thought of that before.
You know, so one of your liberal friends.
Thank you.
Mr. President, 30 seconds.
No comment.
What's the subject matter?
Senator Dole, if you could single out one thing that you would like for the voters to have in their mind about President Clinton on a policy matter or a personal matter, what would it be?
Something to know about him, understand it and appreciate it.
See, if I say anything it's going to be misconstrued.
I don't think there is even a race between the two, it's about our vision for America.
I happen to like President Clinton personally.
I'm addressing him all evening as Mr. President.
I said in 1992 he didn't extend that courtesy to President Bush.
But I respect the presidency.
I've served under a number of presidents.
They all have their strengths and they all have their weaknesses.
So I'd rather talk about my strengths.
And I think I have my strengths and I think the best thing going for Bob Dole is that Bob Dole keeps his word.
It's a question between trust and fear, and I would say, I think, Mr. President, about all you've got going in this campaign is fear.
You're spending millions and millions of dollars in negative ads frightening senior citizens.
I know this to be a fact because I had one tell me last week, Senator don't cut my Medicare.
I'm trying to save your Medicare, just as I rescued Social Security with a bipartisan commission.
I have relatives on Medicare.
I used to sign welfare checks for my grandparents.
I know all about poverty and all about need and all about taking care of people, and that's been my career in the United States Senate.
And I'll keep my word on the economic package.
If I couldn't cut taxes and balance the budget the same time, I wouldn't look at you in the eye in your living room or wherever you might be and say that this is good for America.
People will tell you who served with Bob Dole, agree or disagree, he kept his word.
That's what this race is all about.
I'd like the American people to know that I have worked very hard to be on their side.
And to move this country forward and we're better off than we were four years ago.
But the most important thing is my plan for the 21st Century is a better plan.
A targeted tax cut, a real commitment to educational reform.
A deep commitment to making welfare reform work with incentives to the private sector to move people from welfare to work.
Now we have to create those jobs, now that we're requiring people to go do work.
A commitment to continuing step-by-step healthcare reform with the next step helping people who are between jobs to access healthcare and not lose it just because they are out of work for a while.
A commitment to grow the economy while protecting the environment.
That's what I'd like them to know about me; that I've gotten up every day and worked for the American people and worked so that their children could have their dreams come true.
And I believe we've got the results to show we're on the right track.
The most important thing is, I believe we've got the right ideas for the future.
And I like, I like Senator Dole, you can probably tell we like each other.
We just see the world in different ways.
And you folks out there are going to have to choose who you think is right.
Well, I'd say the first homeless bill in the Senate was the Dole-Byrd Byrd-Dole bill, I can't remember who was in control then.
I remember working with Senator Ribicoff from Connecticut on the Hospice program.
We now have 2500 hospices.
As I said, I've worked all my life when I was in the Congress.
I left on June 11th because I wanted the American people to know that I was willing to give up something.
President Clinton ran for governor in 1990 and said he's going to fill out his term, but he didn't.
He's president so I guess it's a little better deal.
But I wanted the American people to know I was willing to give up something.
I wasn't just getting more power and more power.
So I rolled the dice, I put my career on the line because I really believe the future of America is on the line.
We can give you all these numbers, they don't mean a thing.
If you are out of work, you have nothing to eat or you can't have medical care, or you're holding a crack baby in your arms right now, what do you do next?
You know, America's best days are ahead of us.
I've seen the tough times, I know they can be better and I'll lead America to a brighter future.
Mr. President, what do you say to Senator Dole's point that this election is about keeping one's word?
Let's look at that.
When I ran for president, I said we'd cut the deficit in half in four years; we cut it by 60 percent.
I said that our economic plan would produce eight million jobs, we have ten and a half million new jobs.
We're number one in autos again, record numbers of new small businesses.
I said we'd put, pass a crime bill that would put 100,000 police on the street, ban assault weapons, and deal with the problems that ought to be dealt with with capital punishment, including capital punishment for drug kingpins, and we did that.
I said we would change the way welfare works, and even before the bill passed we'd moved nearly two million people from welfare to work, working with states and communities.
I said we'd get tougher with child support and child support enforcement's up 50 percent.
I said that I would work for tax relief for middle class Americans.
The deficit was bigger than I thought it was going to be.
I think they're better off, all of us are, that we got the interest rates down and the deficit down.
Republicans talk about it, but we're the first the first administration in anybody's lifetime looking at this program to bring that deficit down four years in a row.
We still gave tax cuts to 15 million working Americans, and now I've got a plan that's been out there for two years, it could have been passed already, but instead the Republicans shut the government down to try to force their budget and their plan on me, and I couldn't take that.
But we'll get the rest of that tax relief.
And so I think when you look at those results, you know the plan I've laid out for the future has a very good chance of being enacted if you'll give me a chance to build that bridge to the 21st Century.
Senator.
Well, there he goes again, that line has been used before, I mean, exaggerating all the things that he did.
He didn't do all these things.
Let's take all these four years in a row.
He came in with a high growth rate, the 1990 budget agreement, which some, you know, didn't like, had some very tough cost controls, put a lot of pressure on Congress.
The S &amp; L crisis was over, they're starting to sell assets, all that money was coming in.
And he cut defense an extra $60 billion, threw a lot of people out of work.
He talks about a smaller government.
There are actually more people in government except for people in defense related jobs.
They're gone.
The government's bigger than it was when President Kennedy was around, even though he says it's not.
In addition, Republican Congress cut $53 billion.
So let's just, let's give credit where credit is due.
Governor Engler of Michigan cut taxes 21 times, created a lot of new jobs.
So did Governor Thompson, so did Governor Rowland.
A lot of people ought to deserve credit, Mr. President.
When I'm President of the United States we're going to have a governors' council and we're going to work directly with the governors to get power back to the people and back to the states.
I think a lot of people deserve credit and I've tried to give it to them.
But I believe that my plan is better than Senator Dole's ill-advised $550 billion scheme which I'll say again will blow a hole in the deficit.
Our plan will balance the budget, grow the economy, preserve the environment, and invest in education.
We have the right approach for the future and looks at the results.
It is not midnight in America, Senator.
We are better off than we were four years ago.
All right.
That's the last question, the last answer.
Let's go now to the closing statements.
Mr. President, you're first.
Two minutes.
Well, first, Jim, let me thank you and thank you, Senator Dole, and thank you, ladies and gentlemen, all of you listening tonight for the chance you've given us to appear.
I want to say in the beginning that I am profoundly grateful for the chance that you have given me to serve as president for the last four years.
I never could have dreamed anything like this would come my way in life, and I've done my best to be faithful to the charge you've given me.
I'm proud of the fact that America is stronger and more prosperous and more secure than we were four years ago.
And I'm glad we're going in the right direction.
And I've done my best tonight to lay out my plans for going forward to an even better future in the next century.
I'd like to leave you with the thought that the things I do as president are basically driven by the people whose lives I have seen affected by what does or doesn't happen in this country.
The auto worker in Toledo who was unemployed when I was elected and now has a great job because we're number one in auto production again.
All the people I've met who used to be on welfare who are now working and raising their children.
And I think what others could do for our country and themselves if we did the welfare reform thing in the proper way.
I think of the man who grabbed me by the shoulder once with tears in his eyes and said his daughter was dying of cancer and he thanked me for giving him a chance to spend some time with her without losing his job because of the Family and Medical Leave Act.
I think of all the people I grew up with and went to school with and who I stay in touch with and who nerve let me forget how what we do in Washington affects all of you out there in America.
Folks, we can build that bridge to the 21st Century, big enough and strong enough for all of us to walk across, and I hope you will help me build it.
Senator Dole, your closing statement, sir.
Thank you, Jim; thank you, Mr. President; thank everyone for watching and listening.
I want to address my remarks to the young people of America, because they're the ones that are going to spend most of their life in the 21st Century.
They're the ones who have the challenges and they are people out there making predictions that it's not going to be the same.
You're not going to have the opportunities; there are going to be more deficits, more drugs, more crime, and less confidence in the American people.
And that's what you're faced with, the parents are faced with, and the grand parents are faced with.
It's important, it's their future.
And I would say to those I know there are more young people experimenting with drugs today than ever before; drug use has gone up.
And if you care about the future of America, if you care about your future, just don't do it.
And I know that I'm someone older than you.
But I've had my anxious moments in my life.
I've learned to feed myself and to walk and to dress.
I'm standing here as proof that in America the possibilities are unlimited.
I know who I am, and I know where I'm from, and I know where I want to take America.
We are the greatest country on the face of the earth.
We do more good things for more people in our communities, our neighborhoods, than anywhere that I know of.
This is important business.
This election is important.
I ask for your support, I ask for your help.
And if you really want to get involved, just tap into my home page, www.DoleKemp96.org.
Thank you.
God bless America.
