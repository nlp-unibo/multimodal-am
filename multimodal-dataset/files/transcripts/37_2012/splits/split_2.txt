And in Medicare, what we did was we said, we are going to have to bring down the costs if we're going to deal with our long-term deficits, but to do that, let's look where some of the money's going.
$716 billion we were able to save from the Medicare program by no longer overpaying insurance companies by making sure that we weren't overpaying providers.
And using that money, we were actually able to lower prescription drug costs for seniors by an average of $600, and we were also able to make a -- make a significant dent in providing them the kind of preventive care that will ultimately save money through the -- throughout the system.
So the way for us to deal with Medicare in particular is to lower health care costs.
When it comes to Social Security, as I said, you don't need a major structural change in order to make sure that Social Security is there for the future.
We'll follow up on this.
First, Governor Romney, you have two minutes on Social Security and entitlements.
Well, Jim, our seniors depend on these programs, and I know anytime we talk about entitlements, people become concerned that something's going to happen that's going to change their life for the worse.
And the answer is neither the president nor I are proposing any changes for any current retirees or near retirees, either to Social Security or Medicare.
So if you're 60 or around 60 or older, you don't need to listen any further.
But for younger people, we need to talk about what changes are going to be occurring.
Oh, I just thought about one.
And that is, in fact, I was wrong when I said the president isn't proposing any changes for current retirees.
In fact he is on Medicare.
On Social Security he's not.
But on Medicare, for current retirees, he's cutting $716 billion from the program.
Now, he says by not overpaying hospitals and providers.
Actually just going to them and saying, "We're going to reduce the rates you get paid across the board, everybody's going to get a lower rate."
That's not just going after places where there's abuse.
That's saying we're cutting the rates.
Some 15 percent of hospitals and nursing homes say they won't take anymore Medicare patients under that scenario.
We also have 50 percent of doctors who say they won't take more Medicare patients.
This -- we have 4 million people on Medicare Advantage that will lose Medicare Advantage because of those $716 billion in cuts.
I can't understand how you can cut Medicare $716 billion for current recipients of Medicare.
Now, you point out, well, we're putting some back.
We're going to give a better prescription program.
That's $1 -- that's $1 for every $15 you've cut.
They're smart enough to know that's not a good trade.
I want to take that $716 billion you've cut and put it back into Medicare.
By the way, we can include a prescription program if we need to improve it.
But the idea of cutting $716 billion from Medicare to be able to balance the additional cost of Obamacare is, in my opinion, a mistake.
And with regards to young people coming along, I've got proposals to make sure Medicare and Social Security are there for them without any question.
Mr. President?
First of all, I think it's important for Governor Romney to present this plan that he says will only affect folks in the future.
And the essence of the plan is that you would turn Medicare into a voucher program.
It's called premium support, but it's understood to be a voucher program.
His running mate...
And you don't support that?
I don't.
And let me explain why.
Again, that's for future...
I understand.
... people, right, not for current retirees.
For -- so if you're -- if you're 54 or 55, you might want to listen 'cause this -- this will affect you.
The idea, which was originally presented by Congressman Ryan, your running mate, is that we would give a voucher to seniors and they could go out in the private marketplace and buy their own health insurance.
The problem is that because the voucher wouldn't necessarily keep up with health care inflation, it was estimated that this would cost the average senior about $6,000 a year.
Now, in fairness, what Governor Romney has now said is he'll maintain traditional Medicare alongside it.
But there's still a problem, because what happens is, those insurance companies are pretty clever at figuring out who are the younger and healthier seniors.
They recruit them, leaving the older, sicker seniors in Medicare.
And every health care economist that looks at it says, over time, what'll happen is the traditional Medicare system will collapse.
And then what you've got is folks like my grandmother at the mercy of the private insurance system precisely at the time when they are most in need of decent health care.
So, I don't think vouchers are the right way to go.
And this is not my own -- only my opinion.
AARP thinks that the -- the savings that we obtained from Medicare bolster the system, lengthen the Medicare trust fund by eight years.
Benefits were not affected at all.
And ironically, if you repeal Obamacare, and I have become fond of this term, "Obamacare," if you repeal it, what happens is those seniors right away are going to be paying $600 more in prescription care.
They're now going to have to be paying copays for basic checkups that can keep them healthier.
And the primary beneficiary of that repeal are insurance companies that are estimated to gain billions of dollars back when they aren't making seniors any healthier.
And I don't think that's the right approach when it comes to making sure that Medicare is stronger over the long term.
We'll talk about -- specifically about health care in a moment.
But what -- do you support the voucher system, Governor?
What I support is no change for current retirees and near-retirees to Medicare.
And the president supports taking $716 billion out of that program.
And what about the vouchers?
(CROSSTALK)
So that's -- that's number one.
Number two is for people coming along that are young, what I do to make sure that we can keep Medicare in place for them is to allow them either to choose the current Medicare program or a private plan.
Their choice.
They get to choose -- and they'll have at least two plans that will be entirely at no cost to them.
So they don't have to pay additional money, no additional $6,000.
That's not going to happen.
They'll have at least two plans.
And by the way, if the government can be as efficient as the private sector and offer premiums that are as low as the private sector, people will be happy to get traditional Medicare or they'll be able to get a private plan.
I know my own view is I'd rather have a private plan.
I'd just assume not have the government telling me what kind of health care I get.
I'd rather be able to have an insurance company.
If I don't like them, I can get rid of them and find a different insurance company.
But people make their own choice.
The other thing we have to do to save Medicare?
We have to have the benefits high for those that are low income, but for higher income people, we're going to have to lower some of the benefits.
We have to make sure this program is there for the long term.
That's the plan that I've put forward.
And, by the way the idea came not even from Paul Ryan or -- or Senator Wyden, who's the co-author of the bill with -- with Paul Ryan in the Senate, but also it came from Bill -- Bill Clinton's chief of staff.
This is an idea that's been around a long time, which is saying, hey, let's see if we can't get competition into the Medicare world so that people can get the choice of different plans at lower cost, better quality.
I believe in competition.
Jim, if I -- if I can just respond very quickly, first of all, every study has shown that Medicare has lower administrative costs than private insurance does, which is why seniors are generally pretty happy with it.
And private insurers have to make a profit.
Nothing wrong with that.
That's what they do.
And so you've got higher administrative costs, plus profit on top of that.
And if you are going to save any money through what Governor Romney's proposing, what has to happen is, is that the money has to come from somewhere.
And when you move to a voucher system, you are putting seniors at the mercy of those insurance companies.
And over time, if traditional Medicare has decayed or fallen apart, then they're stuck.
And this is the reason why AARP has said that your plan would weaken Medicare substantially.
And that's why they were supportive of the approach that we took.
One last point I want to make.
We do have to lower the cost of health care, not just in Medicare and Medicaid... LEHRER: Talk about that in a minute.
... but -- but -- but overall.
OK.
And so...
That's -- that's a big topic.
Can we -- can we stay on Medicare?
Is that a -- is that a separate topic?
(CROSSTALK)
Yeah, we're going to -- yeah, I want to get to it.
I'm sorry.
But all I want to do is go very quickly...
Let's get back to Medicare.
... before we leave the economy...
Let's get back to Medicare.
(CROSSTALK)
The president said that the government can provide the service at lower cost and without a profit.
All right.
If that's the case, then it will always be the best product that people can purchase.
Wait a minute, Governor.
But my experience -- my experience the private sector typically is able to provide a better product at a lower cost.
All right.
Can we -- can the two of you agree that the voters have a choice -- a clear choice between the two...
Absolutely.
... of you on Medicare?
Absolutely.
Absolutely.
All right.
So to finish quickly, briefly, on the economy, what is your view about the level of federal regulation of the economy right now?
Is there too much?
And in your case, Mr. President, is there -- should there be more?
Beginning with you.
This is not a new two-minute segment to start.
And we'll go for a few minutes, and then we're going to go to health care, OK?
Regulation is essential.
You can't have a free market work if you don't have regulation.
As a businessperson, I had to have -- I need to know the regulations.
I needed them there.
You couldn't have people opening up banks in their -- in their garage and making loans.
I mean, you have to have regulations so that you can have an economy work.
Every free economy has good regulation.
At the same time, regulation can become excessive.
Is it excessive now, do you think?
In some places, yes.
Other places, no.
Like where?
(CROSSTALK)
No, it can become out of date.
And what's happened with some of the legislation that's been passed during the president's term, you've seen regulation become excessive, and it's hurt -- it's hurt the economy.
Let me give you an example.
Dodd-Frank was passed.
And it includes within it a number of provisions that I think has some unintended consequences that are harmful to the economy.
One is it designates a number of banks as too big to fail, and they're effectively guaranteed by the federal government.
This is the biggest kiss that's been given to -- to New York banks I've ever seen.
This is an enormous boon for them.
There've been 122 community and small banks have closed since Dodd- Frank.
So there's one example.
Here's another.
In Dodd-Frank...
Do you want to repeal Dodd-Frank?
Well, I would repeal and replace it.
We're not going to get rid of all regulation.
You have to have regulation.
And there are some parts of Dodd-Frank that make all the sense in the world.
You need transparency, you need to have leverage limits for...
Well, here's a specific... (CROSSTALK)
But let's -- let's mention -- let me mention the other one.
Let's talk... (CROSSTALK)
No, let's not.
Let's let him respond -- let's let him respond to this specific on Dodd-Frank and what the governor just said.
I think this is a great example.
The reason we have been in such a enormous economic crisis was prompted by reckless behavior across the board.
Now, it wasn't just on Wall Street.
You had loan officers were -- that were giving loans and mortgages that really shouldn't have been given, because the folks didn't qualify.
You had people who were borrowing money to buy a house that they couldn't afford.
You had credit agencies that were stamping these as A1 great investments when they weren't.
But you also had banks making money hand over fist, churning out products that the bankers themselves didn't even understand, in order to make big profits, but knowing that it made the entire system vulnerable.
So what did we do?
We stepped in and had the toughest reforms on Wall Street since the 1930s.
We said you've got -- banks, you've got to raise your capital requirements.
You can't engage in some of this risky behavior that is putting Main Street at risk.
We've going to make sure that you've got to have a living will so -- so we can know how you're going to wind things down if you make a bad bet so we don't have other taxpayer bailouts.
In the meantime, by the way, we also made sure that all the help that we provided those banks was paid back every single dime, with interest.
Now, Governor Romney has said he wants to repeal Dodd-Frank.
And, you know, I appreciate and it appears we've got some agreement that a marketplace to work has to have some regulation.
But in the past, Governor Romney has said he just want to repeal Dodd- Frank, roll it back.
And so the question is: Does anybody out there think that the big problem we had is that there was too much oversight and regulation of Wall Street?
Because if you do, then Governor Romney is your candidate.
But that's not what I believe.
Sorry, but that's just not -- that's just not the facts.
Look, we have to have regulation on Wall Street.
That's why I'd have regulation.
But I wouldn't designate five banks as too big to fail and give them a blank check.
That's one of the unintended consequences of Dodd-Frank.
It wasn't thought through properly.
We need to get rid of that provision because it's killing regional and small banks.
They're getting hurt.
Let me mention another regulation in Dodd-Frank.
You say we were giving mortgages to people who weren't qualified.
That's exactly right.
It's one of the reasons for the great financial calamity we had.
And so Dodd-Frank correctly says we need to have qualified mortgages, and if you give a mortgage that's not qualified, there are big penalties, except they didn't ever go on and define what a qualified mortgage was.
It's been two years.
We don't know what a qualified mortgage is yet.
So banks are reluctant to make loans, mortgages.
Try and get a mortgage these days.
It's hurt the housing market because Dodd-Frank didn't anticipate putting in place the kinds of regulations you have to have.
It's not that Dodd-Frank always was wrong with too much regulation.
Sometimes they didn't come out with a clear regulation.
I will make sure we don't hurt the functioning of our -- of our marketplace and our business, because I want to bring back housing and get good jobs.
All right.
I think we have another clear difference between the two of you.
Now, let's move to health care where I know there is a clear difference, and that has to do with the Affordable Care Act, Obamacare.
And it's a two-minute new -- new segment, and that means two minutes each.
And you go first, Governor Romney.
You want it repealed.
You want the Affordable Care Act repealed.
Why?
I sure do.
Well, in part, it comes, again, from my experience.
You know, I was in New Hampshire.
A woman came to me and she said, look, I can't afford insurance for myself or my son.
I met a couple in Appleton, Wisconsin, and they said, we're thinking of dropping our insurance, we can't afford it.
And the number of small businesses I've gone to that are saying they're dropping insurance because they can't afford it, the cost of health care is just prohibitive.
And -- and we've got to deal with cost.
And, unfortunately, when -- when -- when you look at Obamacare, the Congressional Budget Office has said it will cost $2,500 a year more than traditional insurance.
So it's adding to cost.
And as a matter of fact, when the president ran for office, he said that, by this year, he would have brought down the cost of insurance for each family by $2,500 a family.
Instead, it's gone up by that amount.
So it's expensive.
Expensive things hurt families.
So that's one reason I don't want it.
Second reason, it cuts $716 billion from Medicare to pay for it.
I want to put that money back in Medicare for our seniors.
Number three, it puts in place an unelected board that's going to tell people ultimately what kind of treatments they can have.
I don't like that idea.
Fourth, there was a survey done of small businesses across the country, said, what's been the effect of Obamacare on your hiring plans?
And three-quarters of them said it makes us less likely to hire people.
I just don't know how the president could have come into office, facing 23 million people out of work, rising unemployment, an economic crisis at the -- at the kitchen table, and spend his energy and passion for two years fighting for Obamacare instead of fighting for jobs for the American people.
It has killed jobs.
And the best course for health care is to do what we did in my state: craft a plan at the state level that fits the needs of the state.
And then let's focus on getting the costs down for people, rather than raising it with the $2,500 additional premium.
Mr. President, the argument against repeal?
Well, four years ago, when I was running for office, I was traveling around and having those same conversations that Governor Romney talks about.
And it wasn't just that small businesses were seeing costs skyrocket and they couldn't get affordable coverage even if they wanted to provide it to their employees.
It wasn't just that this was the biggest driver of our federal deficit, our overall health care costs, but it was families who were worried about going bankrupt if they got sick, millions of families, all across the country.
If they had a pre-existing condition, they might not be able to get coverage at all.
If they did have coverage, insurance companies might impose an arbitrary limit.
And so as a consequence, they're paying their premiums, somebody gets really sick, lo and behold, they don't have enough money to pay the bills, because the insurance companies say that they've hit the limit.
So we did work on this, alongside working on jobs, because this is part of making sure that middle-class families are secure in this country.
And let me tell you exactly what Obamacare did.
Number one, if you've got health insurance, it doesn't mean a government takeover.
You keep your own insurance.
You keep your own doctor.
But it does say insurance companies can't jerk you around.
They can't impose arbitrary lifetime limits.
They have to let you keep your kid on their insurance -- your insurance plan until you're 26 years old.
And it also says that you're going to have to get rebates if insurance companies are spending more on administrative costs and profits than they are on actual care.
Number two, if you don't have health insurance, we're essentially setting up a group plan that allows you to benefit from group rates that are typically 18 percent lower than if you're out there trying to get insurance on the individual market.
Now, the last point I'd make before...
Two minutes -- two minutes is up, sir.
No, I think -- I had five seconds before you interrupted me, was ... (LAUGHTER)  ... the irony is that we've seen this model work really well in Massachusetts, because Governor Romney did a good thing, working with Democrats in the state to set up what is essentially the identical model and as a consequence people are covered there.
It hasn't destroyed jobs.
And as a consequence, we now have a system in which we have the opportunity to start bringing down costs, as opposed to just leaving millions of people out in the cold.
Your five seconds went away a long time ago.
All right, Governor.
Governor, tell -- tell the president directly why you think what he just said is wrong about Obamacare?
Well, I did with my first statement.
(CROSSTALK)
First of all, I like the way we did it in Massachusetts.
I like the fact that in my state, we had Republicans and Democrats come together and work together.
What you did instead was to push through a plan without a single Republican vote.
As a matter of fact, when Massachusetts did something quite extraordinary -- elected a Republican senator to stop Obamacare, you pushed it through anyway.
So entirely on a partisan basis, instead of
