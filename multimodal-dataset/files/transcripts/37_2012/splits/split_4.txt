a focus on the fact that folks like myself, folks like Michelle, kids probably who attend University of Denver, just don't have that option.
And for us to be able to make sure that they've got that opportunity and they can walk through that door, that is vitally important not just to those kids.
It's how we're going to grow this economy over the long term.
We're running out of time, gentlemen.
Governor?
Mr. President, Mr. President, you're entitled as the president to your own airplane and to your own house, but not to your own facts.
All right, I'm not going to cut education funding.
I don't have any plan to cut education funding and -- and grants that go to people going to college.
I'm planning on (inaudible) to grow.
So I'm not planning on making changes there.
But you make a very good point, which is that the place you put your money just makes a pretty clear indication of where your heart is.
You put $90 billion into -- into green jobs.
And I -- look, I'm all in favor of green energy.
$90 billion, that would have -- that would have hired 2 million teachers.
$90 billion.
And these businesses, many of them have gone out of business, I think about half of them, of the ones have been invested in have gone out of business.
A number of them happened to be owned by people who were contributors to your campaigns.
Look, the right course for America's government, we were talking about the role of government, is not to become the economic player, picking winners and losers, telling people what kind of health treatment they can receive, taking over the health care system that has existed in this country for a long, long time and has produced the best health records in the world.
The right answer for government is say, How do we make the private sector become more efficient and more effective?
How do we get schools to be more competitive?
Let's grade them.
I propose we grade our schools so parents know which schools are succeeding and failing, so they can take their child to a -- to a school that he's being more successful.
I don't want to cut our commitment to education.
I wanted to make it more effective and efficient.
And by the way, I've had that experience.
I don't just talk about it.
I've been there.
Massachusetts schools are ranked number one in the nation.
This is not because I didn't have commitment to education.
It's because I care about education for all of our kids.
All right, gentlemen... (CROSSTALK)
Excuse me (inaudible).
Excuse me, sir.
We've got -- we've got -- barely have three minutes left.
I'm not going to grade the two of you and say your answers have been too long or I've done a poor job.
You've done a great job.
Oh, well, no.
But the fact is government -- the role of government and governing, we've lost a pod in other words.
So we only have three -- three minutes left in the -- in the debate before we go to your closing statements.
And so I want to ask finally here, and remember, we've got three minutes total time here -- and the question is this.
Many of the legislative functions of the federal government right now are in a state of paralysis as a result of partisan gridlock.
If elected, in your case, if re-elected, in your case, what would you do about that?
Governor?
Jim, I had the great experience -- it didn't seem like it at the time -- of being elected in a state where my legislature was 87 percent Democrat.
And that meant I figured out from day one I had to get along and I had to work across the aisle to get anything done.
We drove our schools to be number one in the nation.
We cut taxes 19 times.
But what would you do as president?
We -- as president, I will sit on day one -- actually, the day after I get elected -- I'll sit down with leaders -- the Democratic leaders, as well as Republican leaders, and continue -- as we did in my state -- we met every Monday for a couple hours, talked about the issues and the challenges in the -- in the -- in our state in that case.
We have to work on a collaborative basis, not because we're going to compromise our principle, but because there's common ground.
And the challenges America faces right now -- look, the reason I'm in this race is there are people that are really hurting today in this country.
And we face -- this deficit could crush the future generations.
What's happening in the Middle East, there are developments around the world that are of real concern.
All right.
And Republicans and Democrats both love America.
But we need to have leadership -- leadership in Washington that will actually bring people together and get the job done and could not care less if -- if it's a Republican or a Democrat.
I've done it before.
I'll do it again.
Mr. President?
Well, first of all, I think Governor Romney's going to have a busy first day, because he's also going to repeal Obamacare, which will not be very popular among Democrats as you're sitting down with them.
(LAUGHTER)  But, look, my philosophy has been, I will take ideas from anybody, Democrat or Republican, as long as they're advancing the cause of making middle-class families stronger and giving ladders of opportunity to the middle class.
That's how we cut taxes for middle- class families and small businesses.
That's how we cut a trillion dollars of spending that wasn't advancing that cause.
That's how we signed three trade deals into law that are helping us to double our exports and sell more American products around the world.
That's how we repealed "don't ask/don't tell."
That's how we ended the war in Iraq, as I promised, and that's how we're going to wind down the war in Afghanistan.
That's how we went after Al Qaida and bin Laden.
So we've -- we've seen progress even under Republican control of the House of Representatives.
But, ultimately, part of being principled, part of being a leader is, A, being able to describe exactly what it is that you intend to do, not just saying, "I'll sit down," but you have to have a plan.
Number two, what's important is occasionally you've got to say no, to -- to -- to folks both in your own party and in the other party.
And, you know, yes, have we had some fights between me and the Republicans when -- when they fought back against us reining in the excesses of Wall Street?
Absolutely, because that was a fight that needed to be had.
When -- when we were fighting about whether or not we were going to make sure that Americans had more security with their health insurance and they said no, yes, that was a fight that we needed to have.
All right
And so part of leadership and governing is both saying what it is that you are for, but also being willing to say no to some things.
And I've got to tell you, Governor Romney, when it comes to his own party during the course of this campaign, has not displayed that willingness to say no to some of the more extreme parts of his party.
That brings us to closing statements.
It was a coin toss.
Governor Romney, you won the toss and you elected to go last, so you have a closing two minutes, Mr. President.
Well, Jim, I want to thank you, and I want to thank Governor Romney, because I think was a terrific debate, and I very much appreciate it.
And I want to thank the University of Denver.
You know, four years ago, we were going through a major crisis.
And yet my faith and confidence in the American future is undiminished.
And the reason is because of its people, because of the woman I met in North Carolina who decided at 55 to go back to school because she wanted to inspire her daughter and now has a job from that new training that she's gotten; because a company in Minnesota who was willing to give up salaries and perks for their executives to make sure that they didn't lay off workers during a recession.
The auto workers that you meet in Toledo or Detroit take such pride in building the best cars in the world, not just because of a paycheck, but because it gives them that sense of pride, that they're helping to build America.
And so the question now is how do we build on those strengths.
And everything that I've tried to do, and everything that I'm now proposing for the next four years in terms of improving our education system or developing American energy or making sure that we're closing loopholes for companies that are shipping jobs overseas and focusing on small businesses and companies that are creating jobs here in the United States, or closing our deficit in a responsible, balanced way that allows us to invest in our future.
All those things are designed to make sure that the American people, their genius, their grit, their determination, is -- is channeled and -- and they have an opportunity to succeed.
And everybody's getting a fair shot.
And everybody's getting a fair share -- everybody's doing a fair share, and everybody's playing by the same rules.
You know, four years ago, I said that I'm not a perfect man and I wouldn't be a perfect president.
And that's probably a promise that Governor Romney thinks I've kept.
But I also promised that I'd fight every single day on behalf of the American people, the middle class, and all those who were striving to get into the middle class.
I've kept that promise and if you'll vote for me, then I promise I'll fight just as hard in a second term.
Governor Romney, your two-minute closing.
Thank you, Jim, and Mr. President.
And thank you for tuning in this evening.
This is a -- this is an important election and I'm concerned about America.
I'm concerned about the direction America has been taking over the last four years.
I -- I know this is bigger than an election about the two of us as individuals.
It's bigger than our respective parties.
It's an election about the course of America.
What kind of America do you want to have for yourself and for your children.
And there really are two very different paths that we began speaking about this evening, and over the course of this month we're going to have two more presidential debates and a vice presidential debate.
We're talk about those two paths.
But they lead in very different directions.
And it's not just looking to our words that you have to take in evidence of where they go.
You can look at the record.
There's no question in my mind that if the president were to be reelected you'll continue to see a middle-class squeeze with incomes going down and prices going up.
I'll get incomes up again.
You'll see chronic unemployment.
We've had 43 straight months with unemployment above 8 percent.
If I'm president I will create -- help create 12 million new jobs in this country with rising incomes.
If the president's reelected, Obamacare will be fully installed.
In my view that's going to mean a whole different way of life for people who counted on the insurance plan they had in the past.
Many will lose it.
You're going to see health premiums go up by some $2,500 per family.
If I'm elected we won't have Obama.
We'll put in place the kind of principles that I put in place in my own state and allow each state to craft their own programs to get people insured and we'll focus on getting the cost of health care down.
If the president were to be reelected you're going to see a $716 billion cut to Medicare.
You'll have 4 million people who will lose Medicare Advantage.
You'll have hospital and providers that'll no longer accept Medicare patients.
I'll restore that $716 billion to Medicare.
And finally, military.
The president's reelected you'll see dramatic cuts to our military.
The secretary of defense has said these would be even devastating.
I will not cut our commitment to our military.
I will keep America strong and get America's middle class working again.
Thank you, Jim.
