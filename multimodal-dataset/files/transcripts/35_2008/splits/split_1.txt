leaders of his party on a single issue.
And we need to reform.
And so let's look at our records as well as our rhetoric.
That's really part of your mistrust here.
And now I suggest that maybe you go to some of these organizations that are the watchdogs of what we do, like the Citizens Against Government Waste or the National Taxpayers Union or these other organizations that watch us all the time.
I don't expect you to watch every vote.
And you know what you'll find?
This is the most liberal big-spending record in the United States Senate.
I have fought against excessive spending and outrages.
I have fought to reduce the earmarks and eliminate them.
Do you know that Senator Obama has voted for -- is proposing $860 billion of new spending now?
New spending.
Do you know that he voted for every increase in spending that I saw come across the floor of the United States Senate while we were working to eliminate these pork barrel earmarks?
He voted for nearly a billion dollars in pork barrel earmark projects, including, by the way, $3 million for an overhead projector at a planetarium in Chicago, Illinois.
My friends, do we need to spend that kind of money?
I think you have to look at my record and you have to look at his.
Then you have to look at our proposals for our economy, not $860 billion in new spending, but for the kinds of reforms that keep people in their jobs, get middle-income Americans working again, and getting our economy moving again.
You're going to be examining our proposals tonight and in the future, and energy independence is a way to do that, is one of them.
And drilling offshore and nuclear power are two vital elements of that.
And I've been supporting those and I know how to fix this economy, and eliminate our dependence on foreign oil, and stop sending $700 billion a year overseas.
We've run out of time.
We have this one-minute discussion period going on here.
There are new economic realities out there that everyone in this hall and across this country understands that there are going to have to be some choices made.
Health policies, energy policies, and entitlement reform, what are going to be your priorities in what order?
Which of those will be your highest priority your first year in office and which will follow in sequence?
Senator McCain?
The three priorities were health...
The three -- health care, energy, and entitlement reform: Social Security and Medicare.
In what order would you put them in terms of priorities?
I think you can work on all three at once, Tom.
I think it's very important that we reform our entitlement programs.
My friends, we are not going to be able to provide the same benefit for present-day workers that we are going -- that present-day retirees have today.
We're going to have to sit down across the table, Republican and Democrat, as we did in 1983 between Ronald Reagan and Tip O'Neill.
I know how to do that.
I have a clear record of reaching across the aisle, whether it be Joe Lieberman or Russ Feingold or Ted Kennedy or others.
That's my clear record.
We can work on nuclear power plants.
Build a whole bunch of them, create millions of new jobs.
We have to have all of the above, alternative fuels, wind, tide, solar, natural gas, clean coal technology.
All of these things we can do as Americans and we can take on this mission and we can overcome it.
My friends, some of this $700 billion ends up in the hands of terrorist organizations.
As far as health care is concerned, obviously, everyone is struggling to make sure that they can afford their premiums and that they can have affordable and available health care.
That's the next issue.
But we can do them all at once.
There's no -- and we have to do them all at once.
All three you mentioned are compelling national security requirements.
I'm trying to play by the rules that you all established.
One minute for discussion.
Senator Obama, if you would give us your list of priorities, there are some real questions about whether everything can be done at once.
We're going to have to prioritize, just like a family has to prioritize.
Now, I've listed the things that I think have to be at the top of the list.
Energy we have to deal with today, because you're paying $3.80 here in Nashville for gasoline, and it could go up.
And it's a strain on your family budget, but it's also bad for our national security, because countries like Russia and Venezuela and, you know, in some cases, countries like Iran, are benefiting from higher oil prices.
So we've got to deal with that right away.
That's why I've called for an investment of $15 billion a year over 10 years.
Our goal should be, in 10 year's time, we are free of dependence on Middle Eastern oil.
And we can do it.
Now, when JFK said we're going to the Moon in 10 years, nobody was sure how to do it, but we understood that, if the American people make a decision to do something, it gets done.
So that would be priority number one.
Health care is priority number two, because that broken health care system is bad not only for families, but it's making our businesses less competitive.
And, number three, we've got to deal with education so that our young people are competitive in a global economy.
But just one point I want to make, Tom.
Senator McCain mentioned looking at our records.
We do need to look at our records.
Senator McCain likes to talk about earmarks a lot.
And that's important.
I want to go line by line through every item in the federal budget and eliminate programs that don't work and make sure that those that do work, work better and cheaper.
But understand this: We also have to look at where some of our tax revenues are going.
So when Senator McCain proposes a $300 billion tax cut, a continuation not only of the Bush tax cuts, but an additional $200 billion that he's going to give to big corporations, including big oil companies, $4 billion worth, that's money out of the system.
And so we've got to prioritize both our spending side and our tax policies to make sure that they're working for you.
That's what I'm going to do as president of the United States.
All right, gentlemen, I want to just remind you one more time about time.
We're going to have a larger deficit than the federal government does if we don't get this under control here before too long.
(LAUGHTER)  Senator McCain, for you, we have our first question from the Internet tonight.
A child of the Depression, 78-year-old Fiora (ph) from Chicago.
Since World War II, we have never been asked to sacrifice anything to help our country, except the blood of our heroic men and women.
As president, what sacrifices -- sacrifices will you ask every American to make to help restore the American dream and to get out of the economic morass that we're now in?
Well, Fiora (ph), I'm going to ask the American people to understand that there are some programs that we may have to eliminate.
I first proposed a long time ago that we would have to examine every agency and every bureaucracy of government.
And we're going to have to eliminate those that aren't working.
I know a lot of them that aren't working.
One of them is in defense spending, because I've taken on some of the defense contractors.
I saved the taxpayers $6.8 billion in a deal for an Air Force tanker that was done in a corrupt fashion.
I believe that we have to eliminate the earmarks.
And sometimes those projects, not -- not the overhead projector that Senator Obama asked for, but some of them that are really good projects, will have -- will have to be eliminated, as well.
And they'll have to undergo the same scrutiny that all projects should in competition with others.
So we're going to have to tell the American people that spending is going to have to be cut in America.
And I recommend a spending freeze that -- except for defense, Veterans Affairs, and some other vital programs, we'll just have to have across-the-board freeze.
And some of those programs may not grow as much as we would like for them to, but we can establish priorities with full transparency, with full knowledge of the American people, and full consultation, not done behind closed doors and shoving earmarks in the middle of the night into programs that we don't even -- sometimes we don't even know about until months later.
And, by the way, I want to go back a second.
Look, we can attack health care and energy at the same time.
We're not -- we're not -- we're not rifle shots here.
We are Americans.
We can, with the participation of all Americans, work together and solve these problems together.
Frankly, I'm not going to tell that person without health insurance that, "I'm sorry, you'll have to wait."
I'm going to tell you Americans we'll get to work right away and we'll get to work together, and we can get them all done, because that's what America has been doing.
Senator McCain, thank you very much.
Senator Obama?
You know, a lot of you remember the tragedy of 9/11 and where you were on that day and, you know, how all of the country was ready to come together and make enormous changes to make us not only safer, but to make us a better country and a more unified country.
And President Bush did some smart things at the outset, but one of the opportunities that was missed was, when he spoke to the American people, he said, "Go out and shop."
That wasn't the kind of call to service that I think the American people were looking for.
And so it's important to understand that the -- I think the American people are hungry for the kind of leadership that is going to tackle these problems not just in government, but outside of government.
And let's take the example of energy, which we already spoke about.
There is going to be the need for each and every one of us to start thinking about how we use energy.
I believe in the need for increased oil production.
We're going to have to explore new ways to get more oil, and that includes offshore drilling.
It includes telling the oil companies, that currently have 68 million acres that they're not using, that either you use them or you lose them.
We're going to have to develop clean coal technology and safe ways to store nuclear energy.
But each and every one of us can start thinking about how can we save energy in our homes, in our buildings.
And one of the things I want to do is make sure that we're providing incentives so that you can buy a fuel efficient car that's made right here in the United States of America, not in Japan or South Korea, making sure that you are able to weatherize your home or make your business more fuel efficient.
And that's going to require effort from each and every one of us.
And the last point I just want to make.
I think the young people of America are especially interested in how they can serve, and that's one of the reasons why I'm interested in doubling the Peace Corps, making sure that we are creating a volunteer corps all across this country that can be involved in their community, involved in military service, so that military families and our troops are not the only ones bearing the burden of renewing America.
That's something that all of us have to be involved with and that requires some leadership from Washington.
Senator Obama, as we begin, very quickly, our discussion period, President Bush, you'll remember, last summer, said that "Wall Street got drunk."
A lot of people now look back and think the federal government got drunk and, in fact, the American consumers got drunk.
How would you, as president, try to break those bad habits of too much debt and too much easy credit, specifically, across the board, for this country, not just at the federal level, but as a model for the rest of the country, as well?
Well, I think it starts with Washington.
We've got to show that we've got good habits, because if we're running up trillion dollar debts that we're passing on to the next generation, then a lot of people are going to think, "Well, you know what?
There's easy money out there."
It means -- and I have to, again, repeat this.
It means looking (ph) at the spending side, but also at the revenue side.
I mean, Senator McCain has been talking tough about earmarks, and that's good, but earmarks account for about $18 billion of our budget.
Now, when Senator McCain is proposing tax cuts that would give the average Fortune 500 CEO an additional $700,000 in tax cuts, that's not sharing a burden.
And so part of the problem, I think, for a lot of people who are listening here tonight is they don't feel as if they are sharing the burden with other folks.
I mean, you know, it's tough to ask a teacher who's making $30,000 or $35,000 a year to tighten her belt when people who are making much more than her are living pretty high on the hog.
And that's why I think it's important for the president to set a tone that says all of us are going to contribute, all of us are going to make sacrifices, and it means that, yes, we may have to cut some spending, although I disagree with Senator McCain about an across-the- board freeze.
That's an example of an unfair burden sharing.
That's using a hatchet to cut the federal budget.
I want to use a scalpel so that people who need help are getting help and those of us, like myself and Senator McCain, who don't need help, aren't getting it.
That's how we make sure that everybody is willing to make a few sacrifices.
Senator McCain?
Well, you know, nailing down Senator Obama's various tax proposals is like nailing Jell-O to the wall.
There has been five or six of them and if you wait long enough, there will probably be another one.
But he wants to raise taxes.
My friends, the last president to raise taxes during tough economic times was Herbert Hoover, and he practiced protectionism as well, which I'm sure we'll get to at some point.
You know, last year up to this time, we've lost 700,000 jobs in America.
The only bright spot is that over 300,000 jobs have been created by small businesses.
Senator Obama's secret that you don't know is that his tax increases will increase taxes on 50 percent of small business revenue.
Small businesses across America will have to cut jobs and will have their taxes increase and won't be able to hire because of Senator Obama's tax policies.
You know, he said some time ago, he said he would forgo his tax increases if the economy was bad.
I've got some news, Senator Obama, the news is bad.
So let's not raise anybody's taxes, my friends, and make it be very clear to you I am not in favor of tax cuts for the wealthy.
I am in favor of leaving the tax rates alone and reducing the tax burden on middle-income Americans by doubling your tax exemption for every child from $3,500 to $7,000.
To giving every American a $5,000 refundable tax credit and go out and get the health insurance you want rather than mandates and fines for small businesses, as Senator Obama's plan calls for.
And let's create jobs and let's get our economy going again.
And let's not raise anybody's taxes.
Senator Obama, we have another question from the Internet.
Tom, can I respond to this briefly?
Because...
Well, look, guys, the rules were established by the two campaigns, we worked very hard on this.
This will address, I think, the next question.
The tax issue, because I think it's very important.
Go ahead.
There are lots of issues that we are going to be dealing with here tonight.
And we have a question from Langdon (ph) in Ballston Spa, New York, and that's about huge unfunded obligations for Social Security, Medicare, and other entitlement programs that will soon eat up all of the revenue that's in place and then go into a deficit position.
Since the rules are pretty loose here, I'm going to add my own to this one.
Instead of having a discussion, let me ask you as a coda to that.
Would you give Congress a date certain to reform Social Security and Medicare within two years after you take office?
Because in a bipartisan way, everyone agrees, that's a big ticking time bomb that will eat us up maybe even more than the mortgage crisis.
Well, Tom, we're going to have to take on entitlements and I think we've got to do it quickly.
We're going to have a lot of work to do, so I can't guarantee that we're going to do it in the next two years, but I'd like to do in the my first term as president.
But I think it's important to understand, we're not going to solve Social Security and Medicare unless we understand the rest of our tax policies.
And you know, Senator McCain, I think the "Straight Talk Express" lost a wheel on that one.
So let's be clear about my tax plan and Senator McCain's, because we're not going to be able to deal with entitlements unless we understand the revenues coming in.
I want to provide a tax cut for 95 percent of Americans, 95 percent.
If you make less than a quarter of a million dollars a year, you will not see a single dime of your taxes go up.
If you make $200,000 a year or less, your taxes will go down.
Now, Senator McCain talks about small businesses.
Only a few percent of small businesses make more than $250,000 a year.
So the vast majority of small businesses would get a tax cut under my plan.
And we provide a 50 percent tax credit so that they can buy health insurance for their workers, because there are an awful lot of small businesses that I meet across America that want to do right by their workers but they just can't afford it.
Some small business owners, a lot of them, can't even afford health insurance for themselves.
Now, in contrast, Senator McCain wants to give a $300 billion tax cut, $200 billion of it to the largest corporations and a hundred thousand of it -- a hundred billion of it going to people like CEOs on Wall Street.
He wants to give average Fortune 500 CEO an additional $700,000 in tax cuts.
That is not fair.
And it doesn't work.
Now, if we get our tax policies right so that they're good for the middle class, if we reverse the policies of the last eight years that got us into this fix in the first place and that Senator McCain supported, then we are going to be in a position to deal with Social Security and deal with Medicare, because we will have a health care plan that actually works for you, reduces spending and costs over the long term, and Social Security that is stable and solvent for all Americans and not just some.
Senator McCain, two years for a reform of entitlement programs?
Sure.
Hey, I'll answer the question.
Look -- look, it's not that hard to fix Social Security, Tom.
It's just...
And Medicare.
... tough decisions.
I want to get to Medicare in a second.
Social Security is not that tough.
We know what the problems are, my friends, and we know what the fixes are.
We've got to sit down together across the table.
It's been done before.
I saw it done with our -- our wonderful Ronald Reagan, a conservative from California, and the liberal Democrat Tip O'Neill from Massachusetts.
That's what we need more of, and that's what I've done in Washington.
Senator Obama has never taken on his party leaders on a single major issue.
I've taken them on.
I'm not too popular sometimes with my own party, much less his.
So Medicare, it's going to be a little tougher.
It's going to be a little tougher
