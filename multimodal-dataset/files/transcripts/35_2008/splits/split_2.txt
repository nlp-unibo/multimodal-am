because we're talking about very complex and difficult issues.
My friends, what we have to do with Medicare is have a commission, have the smartest people in America come together, come up with recommendations, and then, like the base-closing commission idea we had, then we should have Congress vote up or down.
Let's not let them fool with it anymore.
There's too much special interests and too many lobbyists working there.
So let's have -- and let's have the American people say, "Fix it for us."
Now, just back on this -- on this tax, you know, again, it's back to our first question here about rhetoric and record.
Senator Obama has voted 94 times to either increase your taxes or against tax cuts.
That's his record.
When he ran for the United States Senate from Illinois, he said he would have a middle-income tax cut.
You know he came to the Senate and never once proposed legislation to do that?
So let's look at our record.
I've fought higher taxes.
I have fought excess spending.
I have fought to reform government.
Let's look at our records, my friends, and then listen to my vision for the future of America.
And we'll get our economy going again.
And our best days are ahead of us.
Senator McCain, thank you very much.
I'm going to stick by my part of the pact and not ask a follow-up here.
The next question does come from the hall for Senator McCain.
It comes from Section C over here, and it's from Ingrid Jackson (ph).
Ingrid (ph)?
Senator McCain, I want to know, we saw that Congress moved pretty fast in the face of an economic crisis.
I want to know what you would do within the first two years to make sure that Congress moves fast as far as environmental issues, like climate change and green jobs?
Well, thank you.
Look, we are in tough economic times; we all know that.
And let's keep -- never forget the struggle that Americans are in today.
But when we can -- when we have an issue that we may hand our children and our grandchildren a damaged planet, I have disagreed strongly with the Bush administration on this issue.
I traveled all over the world looking at the effects of greenhouse gas emissions, Joe Lieberman and I.
And I introduced the first legislation, and we forced votes on it.
That's the good news, my friends.
The bad news is we lost.
But we kept the debate going, and we kept this issue to -- to posing to Americans the danger that climate change opposes.
Now, how -- what's -- what's the best way of fixing it?
Nuclear power.
Senator Obama says that it has to be safe or disposable or something like that.
Look, I -- I was on Navy ships that had nuclear power plants.
Nuclear power is safe, and it's clean, and it creates hundreds of thousands of jobs.
And -- and I know that we can reprocess the spent nuclear fuel.
The Japanese, the British, the French do it.
And we can do it, too.
Senator Obama has opposed that.
We can move forward, and clean up our climate, and develop green technologies, and alternate -- alternative energies for -- for hybrid, for hydrogen, for battery-powered cars, so that we can clean up our environment and at the same time get our economy going by creating millions of jobs.
We can do that, we as Americans, because we're the best innovators, we're the best producers, and 95 percent of the people who are our market live outside of the United States of America.
Senator Obama?
This is one of the biggest challenges of our times.
And it is absolutely critical that we understand this is not just a challenge, it's an opportunity, because if we create a new energy economy, we can create five million new jobs, easily, here in the United States.
It can be an engine that drives us into the future the same way the computer was the engine for economic growth over the last couple of decades.
And we can do it, but we're going to have to make an investment.
The same way the computer was originally invented by a bunch of government scientists who were trying to figure out, for defense purposes, how to communicate, we've got to understand that this is a national security issue, as well.
And that's why we've got to make some investments and I've called for investments in solar, wind, geothermal.
Contrary to what Senator McCain keeps on saying, I favor nuclear power as one component of our overall energy mix.
But this is another example where I think it is important to look at the record.
Senator McCain and I actually agree on something.
He said a while back that the big problem with energy is that for 30 years, politicians in Washington haven't done anything.
What Senator McCain doesn't mention is he's been there 26 of them.
And during that time, he voted 23 times against alternative fuels, 23 times.
So it's easy to talk about this stuff during a campaign, but it's important for us to understand that it requires a sustained effort from the next president.
One last point I want to make on energy.
Senator McCain talks a lot about drilling, and that's important, but we have three percent of the world's oil reserves and we use 25 percent of the world's oil.
So what that means is that we can't simply drill our way out of the problem.
And we're not going to be able to deal with the climate crisis if our only solution is to use more fossil fuels that create global warming.
We're going to have to come up with alternatives, and that means that the United States government is working with the private sector to fund the kind of innovation that we can then export to countries like China that also need energy and are setting up one coal power plant a week.
We've got to make sure that we're giving them the energy that they need or helping them to create the energy that they need.
Gentlemen, you may not have noticed, but we have lights around here.
They have red and green and yellow and they are to signal...
I'm just trying to keep up with John.
Tom, wave like that and I'll look at you.
All right, Senator.
Here's a follow-up to that, one-minute discussion.
It's a simple question.
Sure.
Should we fund a Manhattan-like project that develops a nuclear bomb to deal with global energy and alternative energy or should we fund 100,000 garages across America, the kind of industry and innovation that developed Silicon Valley?
I think pure research and development investment on the part of the United States government is certainly appropriate.
I think once it gets into productive stages, that we ought to, obviously, turn it over to the private sector.
By the way, my friends, I know you grow a little weary with this back-and-forth.
It was an energy bill on the floor of the Senate loaded down with goodies, billions for the oil companies, and it was sponsored by Bush and Cheney.
You know who voted for it?
You might never know.
That one.
You know who voted against it?
Me.
I have fought time after time against these pork barrel -- these bills that come to the floor and they have all kinds of goodies and all kinds of things in them for everybody and they buy off the votes.
I vote against them, my friends.
I vote against them.
But the point is, also, on oil drilling, oil drilling offshore now is vital so that we can bridge the gap.
We can bridge the gap between imported oil, which is a national security issue, as well as any other, and it will reduce the price of a barrel of oil, because when people know there's a greater supply, then the cost of that will go down.
That's fundamental economics.
We've got to drill offshore, my friends, and we've got to do it now, and we can do it.
And as far as nuclear power is concerned, again, look at the record.
Senator Obama has approved storage and reprocessing of spent nuclear fuel.
And I'll stop, Tom, and you didn't even wave.
Thanks.
Thank you very much, Senator.
Next question for you, Senator Obama, and it comes from the E section over here and it's from Lindsey Trellow (ph).
Lindsey?
Senator, selling health care coverage in America as the marketable commodity has become a very profitable industry.
Do you believe health care should be treated as a commodity?
Well, you know, as I travel around the country, this is one of the single most frequently asked issues that I get, is the issue of health care.
It is breaking family budgets.
I can't tell you how many people I meet who don't have health insurance.
If you've got health insurance, most of you have seen your premiums double over the last eight years.
And your co-payments and deductibles have gone up 30 percent just in the last year alone.
If you're a small business, it's a crushing burden.
So one of the things that I have said from the start of this campaign is that we have a moral commitment as well as an economic imperative to do something about the health care crisis that so many families are facing.
So here's what I would do.
If you've got health care already, and probably the majority of you do, then you can keep your plan if you are satisfied with it.
You can keep your choice of doctor.
We're going to work with your employer to lower the cost of your premiums by up to $2,500 a year.
And we're going to do it by investing in prevention.
We're going to do it by making sure that we use information technology so that medical records are actually on computers instead of you filling forms out in triplicate when you go to the hospital.
That will reduce medical errors and reduce costs.
If you don't have health insurance, you're going to be able to buy the same kind of insurance that Senator McCain and I enjoy as federal employees.
Because there's a huge pool, we can drop the costs.
And nobody will be excluded for pre-existing conditions, which is a huge problem.
Now, Senator McCain has a different kind of approach.
He says that he's going to give you a $5,000 tax credit.
What he doesn't tell you is that he is going to tax your employer-based health care benefits for the first time ever.
So what one hand giveth, the other hand taketh away.
He would also strip away the ability of states to provide some of the regulations on insurance companies to make sure you're not excluded for pre-existing conditions or your mammograms are covered or your maternity is covered.
And that is fundamentally the wrong way to go.
In fact, just today business organizations like the United States Chamber of Commerce, which generally are pretty supportive of Republicans, said that this would lead to the unraveling of the employer-based health care system.
That, I don't think, is the kind of change that we need.
We've got to have somebody who is fighting for patients and making sure that you get decent, affordable health care.
And that's something that I'm committed to doing as president.
Senator McCain?
Well, thank you for the question.
You really identified one of the really major challenges that America faces.
Co-payments go up, costs go up, skyrocketing costs, which make people less and less able to afford health insurance in America.
And we need to do all of the things that are necessary to make it more efficient.
Let's put health records online, that will reduce medical errors, as they call them.
Let's have community health centers.
Let's have walk-in clinics.
Let's do a lot of things to impose efficiencies.
But what is at stake here in this health care issue is the fundamental difference between myself and Senator Obama.
As you notice, he starts talking about government.
He starts saying, government will do this and government will do that, and then government will, and he'll impose mandates.
If you're a small business person and you don't insure your employees, Senator Obama will fine you.
Will fine you.
That's remarkable.
If you're a parent and you're struggling to get health insurance for your children, Senator Obama will fine you.
I want to give every American a $5,000 refundable tax credit.
They can take it anywhere, across state lines.
Why not?
Don't we go across state lines when we purchase other things in America?
Of course it's OK to go across state lines because in Arizona they may offer a better plan that suits you best than it does here in Tennessee.
And if you do the math, those people who have employer-based health benefits, if you put the tax on it and you have what's left over and you add $5,000 that you're going to get as a refundable tax credit, do the math, 95 percent of the American people will have increased funds to go out and buy the insurance of their choice and to shop around and to get -- all of those people will be covered except for those who have these gold-plated Cadillac kinds of policies.
You know, like hair transplants, I might need one of those myself.
But the point is that we have got to give people choice in America and not mandate things on them and give them the ability.
Every parent I know would acquire health insurance for their children if they could.
Obviously small business people want to give their employees health insurance.
Of course they all want to do that.
We've got to give them the wherewithal to do it.
We can do it by giving them, as a start, a $5,000 refundable tax credit to go around and get the health insurance policy of their choice.
Quick discussion.
Is health care in America a privilege, a right, or a responsibility?
Senator McCain?
I think it's a responsibility, in this respect, in that we should have available and affordable health care to every American citizen, to every family member.
And with the plan that -- that I have, that will do that.
But government mandates I -- I'm always a little nervous about.
But it is certainly my responsibility.
It is certainly small-business people and others, and they understand that responsibility.
American citizens understand that.
Employers understand that.
But they certainly are a little nervous when Senator Obama says, if you don't get the health care policy that I think you should have, then you're going to get fined.
And, by the way, Senator Obama has never mentioned how much that fine might be.
Perhaps we might find that out tonight.
Well, why don't -- why don't -- let's talk about this, Tom, because there was just a lot of stuff out there.
Privilege, right or responsibility.
Let's start with that.
Well, I think it should be a right for every American.
In a country as wealthy as ours, for us to have people who are going bankrupt because they can't pay their medical bills -- for my mother to die of cancer at the age of 53 and have to spend the last months of her life in the hospital room arguing with insurance companies because they're saying that this may be a pre-existing condition and they don't have to pay her treatment, there's something fundamentally wrong about that.
So let me -- let me just talk about this fundamental difference.
And, Tom, I know that we're under time constraints, but Senator McCain through a lot of stuff out there.
Number one, let me just repeat, if you've got a health care plan that you like, you can keep it.
All I'm going to do is help you to lower the premiums on it.
You'll still have choice of doctor.
There's no mandate involved.
Small businesses are not going to have a mandate.
What we're going to give you is a 50 percent tax credit to help provide health care for those that you need.
Now, it's true that I say that you are going to have to make sure that your child has health care, because children are relatively cheap to insure and we don't want them going to the emergency room for treatable illnesses like asthma.
And when Senator McCain says that he wants to provide children health care, what he doesn't mention is he voted against the expansion of the Children's Health Insurance Program that is responsible for making sure that so many children who didn't have previously health insurance have it now.
Now, the final point I'll make on this whole issue of government intrusion and mandates -- it is absolutely true that I think it is important for government to crack down on insurance companies that are cheating their customers, that don't give you the fine print, so you end up thinking that you're paying for something and, when you finally get sick and you need it, you're not getting it.
And the reason that it's a problem to go shopping state by state, you know what insurance companies will do?
They will find a state -- maybe Arizona, maybe another state -- where there are no requirements for you to get cancer screenings, where there are no requirements for you to have to get pre-existing conditions, and they will all set up shop there.
That's how in banking it works.
Everybody goes to Delaware, because they've got very -- pretty loose laws when it comes to things like credit cards.
And in that situation, what happens is, is that the protections you have, the consumer protections that you need, you're not going to have available to you.
That is a fundamental difference that I have with Senator McCain.
He believes in deregulation in every circumstance.
That's what we've been going through for the last eight years.
It hasn't worked, and we need fundamental change.
Senator, we want to move on now.
If we'd come back to the hall here, we're going to shift gears here a little bit and we're going to go to foreign policy and international matters, if we can...
I don't believe that -- did we hear the size of the fine?
Phil Elliott (ph) is over here in this section, and Phil Elliott (ph) has a question for Senator McCain.
Phil?
Yes.
Senator McCain, how will all the recent economic stress affect our nation's ability to act as a peacemaker in the world?
Well, I thank you for that question, because there's no doubt that history shows us that nations that are strong militarily over time have to have a strong economy, as well.
And that is one of the challenges that America faces.
But having said that, America -- and we'll hear a lot of criticism.
I've heard a lot of criticism about America, and our national security policy, and all that, and much of that criticism is justified.
But the fact is, America is the greatest force for good in the history of the world.
My friends, we have gone to all four corners of the Earth and shed American blood in defense, usually, of somebody else's freedom and our own.
So we are peacemakers and we're peacekeepers.
But the challenge is to know when the United States of American can beneficially effect the outcome of a crisis, when to go in and when not, when American military power is worth the expenditure of our most precious treasure.
And that question can only be answered by someone with the knowledge and experience and the judgment, the judgment to know when our national security is not only at risk, but where the United States of America can make a difference in preventing genocide, in preventing the spread of terrorism, in doing the things that the United States has done, not always well, but we've done because we're a nation of good.
And I am convinced that my record, going back to my opposition from sending the Marines to Lebanon, to supporting our efforts in Kosovo and Bosnia and the first Gulf War, and my judgment, I think, is something that I'm -- a record that I'm willing to stand on.
Senator Obama was wrong about Iraq and the surge.
He was wrong about Russia when they committed aggression against Georgia.
And in his short career, he does not understand our national security challenges.
We don't have time for on-the-job training, my friends.
Senator Obama, the economic constraints on the U.S. military action around the world.
