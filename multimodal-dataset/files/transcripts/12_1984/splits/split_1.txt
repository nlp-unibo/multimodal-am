bear the market rate.
Make the Soviets pay for their irresponsibility.
That is a very important objective -- to make certain that we continue to look forward to progress toward greater independence by these nations and work with each of them separately.
Mr. President, your rebuttal.
Yes.
I'm not going to continue trying to respond to these repetitions of the falsehoods that have already been stated here.
But with regard to whether Mr. Mondale would be strong, as he said he would be, I know that he has a commercial out where he's appearing on the deck of the Nimitz and watching the F - 14's take off.
And that's an image of strength -- except that if he had had his way when the Nimitz was being planned, he would have been deep in the water out there because there wouldn't have been any Nimitz to stand on -- he was against it.
[Laughter] He was against the F - 14 fighter, he was against the M - 1 tank, he was against the B - 1 bomber, he wanted to cut the salary of all of the military, he wanted to bring home half of the American forces in Europe.
And he has a record of weakness with regard to our national defense that is second to none.
Hear, hear!
Indeed, he was on that side virtually throughout all his years in the Senate.
And he opposed even President Carter, when toward the end of his term President Carter wanted to increase the defense budget.
Mr. Mondale, your rebuttal.
Mr. President, I accept your commitment to peace, but I want you to accept my commitment to a strong national defense.
[Applause] I propose a budget -- I have proposed a budget which would increase our nation's strength, in real terms, by double that of the Soviet Union.
I'll tell you where we disagree.
It is true over 10 years ago I voted to delay production of the F - 14, and I'll tell you why.
The plane wasn't flying the way it was supposed to be; it was a waste of money.
Your definition of national strength is to throw money at the Defense Department.
My definition of national strength is to make certain that a dollar spent buys us a dollar's worth of defense.
There's a big difference between the two of us.
A President must manage that budget.
I will keep us strong, but you'll not do that unless you command that budget and make certain we get the strength that we need.
You pay $500 for a $5 hammer, you're not buying strength.
I would ask the audience not to applaud.
All it does is take up time that we would like to devote to the debate.
Mr. Kondracke, your question to Mr. Mondale.
Use of Military Force
Mr. Mondale, in an address earlier this year you said that before this country resorts to military force, and I'm quoting, "American interests should be sharply defined, publicly supported, congressionally sanctioned, militarily feasible, internationally defensible, open to independent scrutiny, and alert to regional history.''
Now, aren't you setting up such a gauntlet of tests here that adversaries could easily suspect that as President you would never use force to protect American interests?
No.
As a matter of fact, I believe every one of those standards is essential to the exercise of power by this country.
And we can see that in both Lebanon and in Central America.
In Lebanon, this President exercised American power, all right, but the management of it was such that our marines were killed, we had to leave in humiliation, the Soviet Union became stronger, terrorists became emboldened.
And it was because they did not think through how power should be exercised, did not have the American public with them on a plan that worked, that we ended up the way we did.
Similarly, in Central America: What we're doing in Nicaragua with this covert war -- which the Congress, including many Republicans, have tried to stop -- is finally end up with a public definition of American power that hurts us, where we get associated with political assassins and the rest.
We have to decline, for the first time in modern history, jurisdiction in the World Court because they'll find us guilty of illegal actions.
And our enemies are strengthened from all of this.
We need to be strong, we need to be prepared to use that strength, but we must understand that we are a democracy.
We are a government by the people, and when we move, it should be for very severe and extreme reasons that serve our national interests and end up with a stronger country behind us.
It is only in that way that we can persevere.
Nicaragua
You've been quoted as saying that you might quarantine Nicaragua.
I'd like to know what that means.
Would you stop Soviet ships, as President Kennedy did in 1962?
And wouldn't that be more dangerous than President Reagan's covert war?
What I'm referring to there is the mutual self-defense provisions that exist in the Inter-American treaty, the so-called Rio Pact, that permits the nations, our friends in that region, to combine to take steps -- diplomatic and otherwise -- to prevent Nicaragua, when she acts irresponsibly in asserting power in other parts outside of her border, to take those steps, whatever they might be, to stop it.
The Nicaraguans must know that it is the policy of our government that that leadership must stay behind the boundaries of their nation, not interfere in other nations.
And by working with all of the nations in the region -- unlike the policies of this administration and unlike the President said, they have not supported negotiations in that region -- we will be much stronger, because we'll have the moral authority that goes with those efforts.
Lebanon
President Reagan, you introduced U.S. forces into Lebanon as neutral peacekeepers, but then you made them combatants on the side of the Lebanese Government.
Eventually you were forced to withdraw them under fire, and now Syria, a Soviet ally, is dominant in the country.
Doesn't Lebanon represent a major failure on the part of your administration and raise serious questions about your capacity as a foreign policy strategist and as Commander in Chief?
No, Morton, I don't agree to all of those things.
First of all, when we and our allies -- the Italians, the French, and the United Kingdom -- went into Lebanon, we went in there at the request of what was left of the Lebanese Government to be a stabilizing force while they tried to establish a government.
But the first -- pardon me -- the first time we went in, we went in at their request because the war was going on right in Beirut between Israel and the PLO terrorists.
Israel could not be blamed for that.
Those terrorists had been violating their northern border consistently, and Israel chased them all the way to there.
Then we went in with the multinational force to help remove, and did remove, more than 13,000 of those terrorists from Lebanon.
We departed.
And then the Government of Lebanon asked us back in as a stabilizing force while they established a government and sought to get the foreign forces all the way out of Lebanon and that they could then take care of their own borders.
And we were succeeding.
We were there for the better part of a year.
Our position happened to be at the airport.
Oh, there were occasional snipings and sometimes some artillery fire, but we did not engage in conflict that was out of line with our mission.
I will never send troops anywhere on a mission of that kind without telling them that if somebody shoots at them, they can darn well shoot back.
And this is what we did.
We never initiated any kind of action; we defended ourselves there.
But we were succeeding to the point that the Lebanese Government had been organized -- if you will remember, there were the meetings in Geneva in which they began to meet with the hostile factional forces and try to put together some kind of a peace plan.
We were succeeding, and that was why the terrorist acts began.
There are forces there -- and that includes Syria, in my mind -- who don't want us to succeed, who don't want that kind of a peace with a dominant Lebanon, dominant over its own territory.
And so, the terrorist acts began and led to the one great tragedy when they were killed in that suicide bombing of the building.
Then the multilateral force withdrew for only one reason: We withdrew because we were no longer able to carry out the mission for which we had been sent in.
But we went in in the interest of peace and to keep Israel and Syria from getting into the sixth war between them.
And I have no apologies for our going on a peace mission.
Mr. President, 4 years ago you criticized President Carter for ignoring ample warnings that our diplomats in Iran might be taken hostage.
Haven't you done exactly the same thing in Lebanon, not once, but three times, with 300 Americans, not hostages, but dead?
And you vowed swift retaliation against terrorists, but doesn't our lack of response suggest that you're just bluffing?
Morton, no.
I think there's a great difference between the Government of Iran threatening our diplomatic personnel, and there is a government that you can see and can put your hand on.
In the terrorist situation, there are terrorist factions all over.
In a recent 30-day period, 37 terrorist acts in 20 countries have been committed.
The most recent has been the one in Brighton.
In dealing with terrorists, yes, we want to retaliate, but only if we can put our finger on the people responsible and not endanger the lives of innocent civilians there in the various communities and in the city of Beirut where these terrorists are operating.
I have just signed legislation to add to our ability to deal, along with our allies, with this terrorist problem.
And it's going to take all the nations together, just as when we banded together we pretty much resolved the whole problem of skyjackings sometime ago.
Well, the red light went on.
I could have gone on forever.
Mr. Mondale, your rebuttal?
Groucho Marx said, "Who do you believe?
-- me, or your own eyes?''
And what we have in Lebanon is something that the American people have seen.
The Joint Chiefs urged the President not to put our troops in that barracks because they were indefensible.
They went to him 5 days before they were killed and said, "Please, take them out of there.''
The Secretary of State admitted that this morning.
He did not do so.
The report following the explosion of the barracks disclosed that we had not taken any of the steps that we should have taken.
That was the second time.
Then the Embassy was blown up a few weeks ago, and once again none of the steps that should have been taken were taken.
And we were warned 5 days before that explosives were on their way, and they weren't taken.
The terrorists have won each time.
The President told the terrorists he was going to retaliate.
He didn't.
They called their bluff.
And the bottom line is that the United States left in humiliation, and our enemies are stronger.
Mr. President, your rebuttal?
Yes.
First of all, Mr. Mondale should know that the President of the United States did not order the marines into that barracks.
That was a command decision made by the commanders on the spot and based with what they thought was best for the men there.
That is one.
On the other things that you've just said about the terrorists, I'm tempted to ask you what you would do.
These are unidentified people, and after the bomb goes off, they're blown to bits because they are suicidal individuals who think they're going to go to paradise if they perpetrate such an act and lose their life in doing it.
We are going to, as I say, we're busy trying to find the centers where these operations stem from, and retaliation will be taken.
But we're not going to simply kill some people to say, "Oh, look, we got even.''
We want to know when we retaliate that we're retaliating with those who are responsible for the terrorist acts.
And terrorist acts are such that our own United States Capitol in Washington has been bombed twice.
Mr. Trewhitt, your question to President Reagan?
The President's Age  Mr. Trewhitt.
Mr. President, I want to raise an issue that I think has been lurking out there for 2 or 3 weeks and cast it specifically in national security terms.
You already are the oldest President in history.
And some of your staff say you were tired after your most recent encounter with Mr. Mondale.
I recall yet that President Kennedy had to go for days on end with very little sleep during the Cuban missile crisis.
Is there any doubt in your mind that you would be able to function in such circumstances?
Not at all, Mr. Trewhitt, and I want you to know that also I will not make age an issue of this campaign.
I am not going to exploit, for political purposes, my opponent's youth and inexperience.
[Laughter and applause] If I still have time, I might add, Mr. Trewhitt, I might add that it was Seneca or it was Cicero, I don't know which, that said, "If it was not for the elders correcting the mistakes of the young, there would be no state.''
Strategic Missiles  Mr. Trewhitt.
Mr. President, I'd like to head for the fence and try to catch that one before it goes over, but I'll go on to another question.
You and Mr. Mondale have already disagreed about what you had to say about recalling submarine-launched missiles.
There's another, a similar issue out there that relates to your -- it is said, at least, that you were unaware that the Soviet retaliatory power was based on land-based missiles.
First, is that correct?
Secondly, if it is correct, have you informed yourself in the meantime?
And third, is it even necessary for the President to be so intimately involved in strategic details?
Yes, this had to do with our disarmament talks.
And the whole controversy about land missiles came up because we thought that the strategic nuclear weapons, the most destabilizing are the land-based.
You put your thumb on a button and somebody blows up 20 minutes later.
So, we thought that it would be simpler to negotiate first with those.
And then we made it plain, a second phase, take up the submarine-launched or the airborne missiles.
The Soviet Union, to our surprise -- and not just mine -- made it plain when we brought this up that they placed, they thought, a greater reliance on the land-based missiles and, therefore, they wanted to take up all three.
And we agreed.
We said, "All right, if that's what you want to do.''
But it was a surprise to us, because they outnumbered us 64 to 36 in submarines and 20 percent more bombers capable of carrying nuclear missiles than we had.
So, why should we believe that they had placed that much more reliance on land-based?
But even after we gave in and said, "All right, let's discuss it all,'' they walked away from the table.
We didn't.
The President's Age  Mr. Trewhitt.
Mr. Mondale, I'm going to hang in there.
Should the President's age and stamina be an issue in the political campaign?
No.
And I have not made it an issue, nor should it be.
What's at issue here is the President's application of his authority to understand what a President must know to lead this nation, secure our defense, and make the decisions and the judgments that are necessary.
A minute ago the President quoted Cicero, I believe.
I want to quote somebody a little closer to home, Harry Truman.
He said, "The buck stops here.''
We just heard the President's answer for the problems at the barracks in Lebanon, where 241 marines were killed.
What happened?
First, the Joint Chiefs of Staff went to the President, said, "Don't put those troops there.''
They did it.
And then 5 days before the troops were killed, they went back to the President, through the Secretary of Defense, and said, "Please, Mr. President, take those troops out of there because we can't defend them.''
They didn't do it.
And we know what happened.
After that, once again, our Embassy was exploded.
This is the fourth time this has happened -- an identical attack, in the same region, despite warnings -- even public warnings -- from the terrorists.
Who's in charge?
Who's handling this matter?
That's my main point.
Now, on arms control, we're completing 4 years.
This is the first administration since the bomb went off that made no progress.
We have an arms race underway instead.
A President has to lead his government or it won't be done.
Different people with different views fight with each other.
For 3\1/2\ years, this administration avoided arms control, resisted tabling arms control proposals that had any hope of agreeing, rebuked their negotiator in 1981 when he came close to an agreement, at least in principle, on medium-range weapons.
And we have this arms race underway.
And a recent book that just came out by perhaps the Nation's most respected author in this field, Strobe Talbott, called "Deadly Gambits,'' concludes that this President has failed to master the essential details needed to command and lead us, both in terms of security and terms of arms control.
That's why they call the President the Commander in Chief.
Good intentions, I grant.
But it takes more than that.
You must be tough and smart.
The President's Leadership  Mr. Trewhitt.
This question of leadership keeps arising in different forms in this discussion already.
And the President, Mr. Mondale, has called you whining and vacillating, among the more charitable phrases -- weak, I believe.
It is a question of leadership.
And he has made the point that you have not repudiated some of the semidiplomatic activity of the Reverend Jackson, particularly in Central America.
Did you approve of his diplomatic activity?
And are you prepared to repudiate him now?
I read his statement the other day.
I don't admire Fidel Castro at all.
And I've said that.
Che Guevara was a contemptible figure in civilization's history.
I know the Cuban state as a police state, and all my life I've worked in a way that demonstrates that.
But Jesse Jackson is an independent person.
I don't control him.
And let's talk about people we do control.
In the last debate,\1\ (FOOTNOTE) the Vice President of the United States said that I said the marines had died shamefully and died in shame in Lebanon.
I demanded an apology from Vice President Bush because I had, instead, honored these young men, grieved for their families, and think they were wonderful Americans that honored us all.
What does the President have to say about taking responsibility for a Vice President who won't apologize for something like that?
(FOOTNOTE) \1\Mr.
Mondale was referring to an earlier debate between George Bush and Geraldine Ferarro, the Vice-Presidential candidates.
Mr. President, your rebuttal?
Yes.
I know it'll come as a surprise to Mr. Mondale, but I am in charge.
And, as a matter of fact, we haven't avoided arms control talks with the Soviet Union.
Very early in my administration I proposed -- and I think something that had never been proposed by any previous administration -- I proposed a total elimination of intermediate-range missiles, where the Soviets had better than a 10
