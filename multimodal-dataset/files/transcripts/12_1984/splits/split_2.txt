-- and still have -- better than a 10-to-1 advantage over the allies in Europe.
When they protested that and suggested a smaller number, perhaps, I went along with that.
The so-called negotiation that you said I walked out on was the so-called walk in the woods between one of our representatives and one of the Soviet Union, and it wasn't me that turned it down, the Soviet Union disavowed it.
Mr. Mondale, your rebuttal?
There are two distinguished authors on arms control in this country -- there are many others, but two that I want to cite tonight.
One is Strobe Talbott in his classic book, "Deadly Gambits.''
The other is John Neuhaus, who's one of the most distinguished arms control specialists in our country.
Both said that this administration turned down the "walk in the woods'' agreement first, and that would have been a perfect agreement from the standpoint of the United States in Europe and our security.
When Mr. Nitze, a good negotiator, returned, he was rebuked, and his boss was fired.
This is the kind of leadership that we've had in this administration on the most deadly issue of our times.
Now we have a runaway arms race.
All they've got to show for 4 years in U.S.-Soviet relations is one meeting in the last weeks of an administration, and nothing before.
They're tough negotiators, but all previous Presidents have made progress.
This one has not.
Ms. Geyer, your question to Mr. Mondale.
Illegal Immigration
Mr. Mondale, many analysts are now saying that actually our number one foreign policy problem today is one that remains almost totally unrecognized: massive illegal immigration from economically collapsing countries.
They are saying that it is the only real territorial threat to the American nation-state.
You, yourself, said in the 1970's that we had a "hemorrhage on our borders.''
Yet today you have backed off any immigration reform, such as the balanced and highly crafted Simpson-Mazzoli bill.
Why?
What would you do instead today, if anything?
This is a very serious problem in our country, and it has to be dealt with.
I object to that part of the Simpson-Mazzoli bill which I think is very unfair and would prove to be so.
That is the part that requires employers to determine the citizenship of an employee before they're hired.
I'm convinced that the result of this would be that people who are Hispanic, people who have different languages or speak with an accent, would find it difficult to be employed.
I think that's wrong.
We've never had citizenship tests in our country before, and I don't think we should have a citizenship card today.
That is counterproductive.
I do support the other aspects of the Simpson-Mazzoli bill that strengthen enforcement at the border, strengthen other ways of dealing with undocumented workers in this difficult area and dealing with the problem of settling people who have lived here for many, many years and do not have an established status.
I have further strongly recommended that this administration do something it has not done, and that is to strengthen enforcement at the border, strengthen the officials in this government that deal with undocumented workers, and to do so in a way that's responsible and within the Constitution of the United States.
We need an answer to this problem, but it must be an American answer that is consistent with justice and due process.
Everyone in this room, practically, here tonight, is an immigrant.
We came here loving this nation, serving it, and it has served all of our most bountiful dreams.
And one of those dreams is justice.
And we need a measure -- and I will support a measure -- that brings about those objectives but avoids that one aspect that I think is very serious.
The second part is to maintain and improve relations with our friends to the south.
We cannot solve this problem all on our own.
And that's why the failure of this administration to deal in an effective and a good-faith way with Mexico, with Costa Rica, with the other nations in trying to find a peaceful settlement to the dispute in Central America has undermined our capacity to effectively deal diplomatically in this area as well.
Sir, people as well-balanced and just as Father Theodore Hesburgh at Notre Dame, who headed the select commission on immigration, have pointed out repeatedly that there will be no immigration reform without employer sanctions, because it would be an unbalanced bill, and there would be simply no way to enforce it.
However, putting that aside for the moment, your critics have also said repeatedly that you have not gone along with the bill or with any immigration reform because of the Hispanic groups -- or Hispanic leadership groups -- who actually do not represent what the Hispanic-Americans want, because polls show that they overwhelmingly want some kind of immigration reform.
Can you say, or how can you justify your position on this?
And how do you respond to the criticism that this is another, or that this is an example of your flip-flopping and giving in to special interest groups at the expense of the American nation?
I think you're right that the polls show that the majority of Hispanics want that bill, so I'm not doing it for political reasons.
I'm doing it because all my life I've fought for a system of justice in this country, a system in which every American has a chance to achieve the fullness in life without discrimination.
This bill imposes upon employers the responsibility of determining whether somebody who applies for a job is an American or not.
And just inevitably, they're going to be reluctant to hire Hispanics or people with a different accent.
If I were dealing with politics here, the polls show the American people want this.
I am for reform in this area, for tough enforcement at the border, and for many other aspects of the Simpson-Mazzoli bill, but all my life I've fought for a fair nation.
And despite the politics of it, I stand where I stand, and I think I'm right, and before this fight is over we're going to come up with a better bill, a more effective bill that does not undermine the liberties of our people.
Mr. President, you, too, have said that our borders are out of control.
Yet this fall you allowed the Simpson-Mazzoli bill -- which would at least have minimally protected our borders and the rights of citizenship -- because of a relatively unimportant issue of reimbursement to the States for legalized aliens.
Given that, may I ask what priority can we expect you to give this forgotten national security element?
How sincere are you in your efforts to control, in effect, the nation-state that is the United States?
Georgie Anne, we, believe me, supported the Simpson-Mazzoli bill strongly -- and the bill that came out of the Senate.
However, there were things added in in the House side that we felt made it less of a good bill; as a matter of fact, made it a bad bill.
And in conference -- we stayed with them in conference all the way to where even Senator Simpson did not want the bill in the manner in which it would come out of the conference committee.
There were a number of things in there that weakened that bill.
I can't go into detail about them here.
But it is true our borders are out of control.
It is also true that this has been a situation on our borders back through a number of administrations.
And I supported this bill.
I believe in the idea of amnesty for those who have put down roots and who have lived here even though sometime back they may have entered illegally.
With regard to the employer sanctions, we must have that not only to ensure that we can identify the illegal aliens, but also, while some keep protesting about what it would do to employers, there is another employer that we shouldn't be so concerned about, and these are employers down through the years who have encouraged the illegal entry into this country because they then hire these individuals and hire them at starvation wages and with none of the benefits that we think are normal and natural for workers in our country, and the individuals can't complain because of their illegal status.
We don't think that those people should be allowed to continue operating free.
And this was why the provisions that we had in with regard to sanctions, and so forth -- and I'm going to do everything I can, and all of us in the administration are, to join in again when Congress is back at it to get an immigration bill that will give us, once again, control of our borders.
And with regard to friendship below the border and with the countries down there, yes, no administration that I know has established the relationship that we have with our Latin friends.
But as long as they have an economy that leaves so many people in dire poverty and unemployment, they are going to seek that employment across our borders.
And we work with those other countries.
Mr. President, the experts also say that the situation today is terribly different quantitatively -- qualitatively different from what it has been in the past because of the gigantic population growth.
For instance, Mexico's population will go from about 60 million today to 120 million at the turn of the century.
Many of these people will be coming into the United States not as citizens, but as illegal workers.
You have repeatedly said recently that you believe that Armageddon, the destruction of the world, may be imminent in our times.
Do you ever feel that we are in for an Armageddon or a situation, a time of anarchy, regarding the population explosion in the world?
No.
As a matter of fact, the population explosion, if you look at the actual figures, has been vastly exaggerated -- over exaggerated.
As a matter of fact, there are some pretty scientific and solid figures about how much space there still is in the world and how many more people we can have.
It's almost like going back to the Malthusian theory, when even then they were saying that everyone would starve with the limited population they had then.
But the problem of population growth is one, here, with regard to our immigration.
And we have been the safety valve, whether we wanted to or not, with the illegal entry here, in Mexico, where their population is increasing and they don't have an economy that can absorb them and provide the jobs.
And this is what we're trying to work out, not only to protect our own borders but to have some kind of fairness and recognition of that problem.
Mr. Mondale, your rebuttal?
One of the biggest problems today is that the countries to our south are so desperately poor that these people who will almost lose their lives if they don't come north, come north despite all the risks.
And if we're going to find a permanent, fundamental answer to this, it goes to American economic and trade policies that permit these nations to have a chance to get on their own two feet and to get prosperity, so that they can have jobs for themselves and their people.
And that's why this enormous national debt, engineered by this administration, is harming these countries in fueling this immigration.
These high interest rates -- real rates that have doubled under this administration -- have had the same effect on Mexico and so on, and the cost of repaying those debts is so enormous that it results in massive unemployment, hardship, and heartache.
And that drives our friends to the south up into our region, and we need to end those deficits as well.
Mr. President, your rebuttal.
Well, my rebuttal is I've heard the national debt blamed for a lot of things, but not for illegal immigration across our border -- [laughter] -- and it has nothing to do with it.
But with regard to these high interest rates, too, at least give us the recognition of the fact that when you left office, Mr. Mondale, they were 21\1/2\ -- the prime rate.
It's now 12\1/4\, and I predict it'll be coming down a little more shortly.
So, we're trying to undo some of the things that your administration did.
[Applause]
No applause, please.
Mr. Kalb, your question to President Reagan.
Armageddon
Mr. President, I'd like to pick up this Armageddon theme.
You've been quoted as saying that you do believe, deep down, that we are heading for some kind of biblical Armageddon.
Your Pentagon and your Secretary of Defense have plans for the United States to fight and prevail in a nuclear war.
Do you feel that we are now heading perhaps, for some kind of nuclear Armageddon?
And do you feel that this country and the world could survive that kind of calamity?
Mr. Kalb, I think what has been hailed as something I'm supposedly, as President, discussing as principle is the recall of just some philosophical discussions with people who are interested in the same things; and that is the prophecies down through the years, the biblical prophecies of what would portend the coming of Armageddon, and so forth, and the fact that a number of theologians for the last decade or more have believed that this was true, that the prophecies are coming together that portend that.
But no one knows whether Armageddon, those prophecies mean that Armageddon is a thousand years away or day after tomorrow.
So, I have never seriously warned and said we must plan according to Armageddon.
Now, with regard to having to say whether we would try to survive in the event of a nuclear war, of course we would.
But let me also point out that to several parliaments around the world, in Europe and in Asia, I have made a statement to each one of them, and I'll repeat it here: A nuclear war cannot be won and must never be fought.
And that is why we are maintaining a deterrent and trying to achieve a deterrent capacity to where no one would believe that they could start such a war and escape with limited damage.
But the deterrent -- and that's what it is for -- is also what led me to propose what is now being called the Star Wars concept, but propose that we research to see if there isn't a defensive weapon that could defend against incoming missiles.
And if such a defense could be found, wouldn't it be far more humanitarian to say that now we can defend against a nuclear war by destroying missiles instead of slaughtering millions of people?
Strategic Defense Initiative
Mr. President, when you made that proposal, the so-called Star Wars proposal, you said, if I'm not mistaken, that you would share this very super-sophisticated technology with the Soviet Union.
After all of the distrust over the years, sir, that you have expressed towards the Soviet Union, do you really expect anyone to take seriously that offer that you would share the best of America's technology in this weapons area with our principal adversary?
Why not?
What if we did -- and I hope we can; we're still researching -- what if we come up with a weapon that renders those missiles obsolete?
There has never been a weapon invented in the history of man that has not led to a defensive, a counterweapon.
But suppose we came up with that?
Now, some people have said, "Ah, that would make war imminent, because they would think that we could launch a first strike because we could defend against the enemy.''
But why not do what I have offered to do and asked the Soviet Union to do?
Say, "Look, here's what we can do.
We'll even give it to you.
Now, will you sit down with us and once and for all get rid, all of us, of these nuclear weapons and free mankind from that threat?''
I think that would be the greatest use of a defensive weapon.
Mr. Mondale, you've been very sharply critical of the President's Strategic Defense Initiative.
And yet, what is wrong with a major effort by this country to try to use its best technology to knock out as many incoming nuclear warheads as possible?
First of all, let me sharply disagree with the President on sharing the most advanced, the most dangerous, the most important technology in America with the Soviet Union.
We have had for many years, understandably, a system of restraints on high technology because the Soviets are behind us.
And any research or development along the Star Wars schemes would inevitably involve our most advanced computers, our most advanced engineering.
And the thought that we would share this with the Soviet Union is, in my opinion, a total non-STARTer.
I would not let the Soviet Union get their hands on it at all.
Now, what's wrong with Star Wars?
There's nothing wrong with the theory of it.
If we could develop a principle that would say both sides could fire all their missiles and no one would get hurt, I suppose it's a good idea.
But the fact of it is we're so far away from research that even comes close to that, that the Director of Engineering Research at the Defense Department said to get there we would have to solve eight problems, each of which are more difficult than the atomic bomb and the Manhattan project.
It would cost something like a trillion dollars to test and deploy weapons.
The second thing is this all assumes that the Soviets wouldn't respond in kind.
And they always do.
We don't get behind.
They won't get behind.
And that's been the tragic story of the arms race.
We have more at stake in space satellites than they do.
If we could stop, right now, the testing and the deployment of these space weapons -- and the President's proposals go clear beyond research; if it was just research we wouldn't have any argument, because maybe someday, somebody will think of something -- but to commit this nation to a buildup of antisatellite and space weapons at this time, in their crude state, would bring about an arms race that's very dangerous indeed.
One final point.
The most dangerous aspect of this proposal is, for the first time, we would delegate to computers the decision as to whether to start a war.
That's dead wrong.
There wouldn't be time for a President to decide; it would be decided by these remote computers.
It might be an oil fire, it might be a jet exhaust, the computer
