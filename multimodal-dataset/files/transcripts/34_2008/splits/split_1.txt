for people making over $250,000, which is $130 billion this year alone.
We're not going to support the $300 billion tax cut that they have for corporate America and the very wealthy.
We're not going to support another $4 billion tax cut for ExxonMobil.
And what we're not going to also hold up on, Gwen, is we cannot afford to hold up on providing for incentives for new jobs by an energy policy, creating new jobs.
We cannot slow up on education, because that's the engine that is going to give us the economic growth and competitiveness that we need.
And we are not going to slow up on the whole idea of providing for affordable health care for Americans, none of which, when we get to talk about health care, is as my -- as the governor characterized -- characterized.
The bottom line here is that we are going to, in fact, eliminate those wasteful spending that exist in the budget right now, a number of things I don't have time, because the light is blinking, that I won't be able to mention, but one of which is the $100 billion tax dodge that, in fact, allows people to take their post office box off- shore, avoid taxes.
I call that unpatriotic.
I call that unpatriotic.
Governor?
That's what I'm talking about.
Governor?
Well, the nice thing about running with John McCain is I can assure you he doesn't tell one thing to one group and then turns around and tells something else to another group, including his plans that will make this bailout plan, this rescue plan, even better.I want to go back to the energy plan, though, because this is -- this is an important one that Barack Obama, he voted for in '05.
Senator Biden, you would remember that, in that energy plan that Obama voted for, that's what gave those oil companies those big tax breaks.
Your running mate voted for that.
You know what I had to do in the state of Alaska?
I had to take on those oil companies and tell them, "No," you know, any of the greed there that has been kind of instrumental, I guess, in their mode of operation, that wasn't going to happen in my state.
And that's why Tillerson at Exxon and Mulva at ConocoPhillips, bless their hearts, they're doing what they need to do, as corporate CEOs, but they're not my biggest fans, because what I had to do up there in Alaska was to break up a monopoly up there and say, you know, the people are going to come first and we're going to make sure that we have value given to the people of Alaska with those resources.
And those huge tax breaks aren't coming to the big multinational corporations anymore, not when it adversely affects the people who live in a state and, in this case, in a country who should be benefiting at the same time.
So it was Barack Obama who voted for that energy plan that gave those tax breaks to the oil companies that I then had to turn around, as a governor of an energy-producing state, and kind of undo in my own area of expertise, and that's energy.
So, Governor, as vice president, there's nothing that you have promised as a candidate that you would -- that you wouldn't take off the table because of this financial crisis we're in?
There is not.
And how long have I been at this, like five weeks?
So there hasn't been a whole lot that I've promised, except to do what is right for the American people, put government back on the side of the American people, stop the greed and corruption on Wall Street.And the rescue plan has got to include that massive oversight that Americans are expecting and deserving.
And I don't believe that John McCain has made any promise that he would not be able to keep, either.
Senator?
Again, let me -- let's talk about those tax breaks.
Barack Obama -- Obama voted for an energy bill because, for the first time, it had real support for alternative energy.When there were separate votes on eliminating the tax breaks for the oil companies, Barack Obama voted to eliminate them.
John did not.
And let me just ask a rhetorical question: If John really wanted to eliminate them, why is he adding to his budget an additional $4 billion in tax cuts for ExxonMobils of the world that, in fact, already have made $600 billion since 2001?
And, look, I agree with the governor.
She imposed a windfall profits tax up there in Alaska.
That's what Barack Obama and I want to do.
We want to be able to do for all of you Americans, give you back $1,000 bucks, like she's been able to give back money to her folks back there.
But John McCain will not support a windfall profits tax.
They've made $600 billion since 2001, and John McCain wants to give them, all by itself -- separate, no additional bill, all by itself -- another $4 billion tax cut.
If that is not proof of what I say, I'm not sure what can be.
So I hope the governor is able to convince John McCain to support our windfall profits tax, which she supported in Alaska, and I give her credit for it.
Next question, Governor Palin, still on the economy.
Last year, Congress passed a bill that would make it more difficult for debt-strapped mortgage-holders to declare bankruptcy, to get out from under that debt.
This is something that John McCain supported.
Would you have?
Yes, I would have.
But here, again, there have -- there have been so many changes in the conditions of our economy in just even these past weeks that there has been more and more revelation made aware now to Americans about the corruption and the greed on Wall Street.We need to look back, even two years ago, and we need to be appreciative of John McCain's call for reform with Fannie Mae, with Freddie Mac, with the mortgage-lenders, too, who were starting to really kind of rear that head of abuse.
And the colleagues in the Senate weren't going to go there with him.
So we have John McCain to thank for at least warning people.
And we also have John McCain to thank for bringing in a bipartisan effort people to the table so that we can start putting politics aside, even putting a campaign aside, and just do what's right to fix this economic problem that we are in.
It is a crisis.
It's a toxic mess, really, on Main Street that's affecting Wall Street.
And now we have to be ever vigilant and also making sure that credit markets don't seize up.
That's where the Main Streeters like me, that's where we would really feel the effects.
Senator Biden, you voted for this bankruptcy bill.
Senator Obama voted against it.
Some people have said that mortgage- holders really paid the price.
Well, mortgage-holders didn't pay the price.
Only 10 percent of the people who are -- have been affected by this whole switch from Chapter 7 to Chapter 13 -- it gets complicated.But the point of this -- Barack Obama saw the glass as half- empty.
I saw it as half-full.
We disagreed on that, and 85 senators voted one way, and 15 voted the other way.
But here's the deal.
Barack Obama pointed out two years ago that there was a subprime mortgage crisis and wrote to the secretary of Treasury.
And he said, "You'd better get on the stick here.
You'd better look at it."
John McCain said as early as last December, quote -- I'm paraphrasing -- "I'm surprised about this subprime mortgage crisis," number one.
Number two, with regard to bankruptcy now, Gwen, what we should be doing now -- and Barack Obama and I support it -- we should be allowing bankruptcy courts to be able to re-adjust not just the interest rate you're paying on your mortgage to be able to stay in your home, but be able to adjust the principal that you owe, the principal that you owe.
That would keep people in their homes, actually help banks by keeping it from going under.
But John McCain, as I understand it -- I'm not sure of this, but I believe John McCain and the governor don't support that.
There are ways to help people now.
And there -- ways that we're offering are not being supported by -- by the Bush administration nor do I believe by John McCain and Governor Palin.
Governor Palin, is that so?
That is not so, but because that's just a quick answer, I want to talk about, again, my record on energy versus your ticket's energy ticket, also.I think that this is important to come back to, with that energy policy plan again that was voted for in '05.
When we talk about energy, we have to consider the need to do all that we can to allow this nation to become energy independent.
It's a nonsensical position that we are in when we have domestic supplies of energy all over this great land.
And East Coast politicians who don't allow energy-producing states like Alaska to produce these, to tap into them, and instead we're relying on foreign countries to produce for us.
We're circulating about $700 billion a year into foreign countries, some who do not like America -- they certainly don't have our best interests at heart -- instead of those dollars circulating here, creating tens of thousands of jobs and allowing domestic supplies of energy to be tapped into and start flowing into these very, very hungry markets.Energy independence is the key to this nation's future, to our economic future, and to our national security.
So when we talk about energy plans, it's not just about who got a tax break and who didn't.
And we're not giving oil companies tax breaks, but it's about a heck of a lot more than that.
Energy independence is the key to America's future.
Governor, I'm happy to talk to you in this next section about energy issues.
Let's talk about climate change.
What is true and what is false about what we have heard, read, discussed, debated about the causes of climate change?
Yes.
Well, as the nation's only Arctic state and being the governor of that state, Alaska feels and sees impacts of climate change more so than any other state.
And we know that it's real.I'm not one to attribute every man -- activity of man to the changes in the climate.
There is something to be said also for man's activities, but also for the cyclical temperature changes on our planet.
But there are real changes going on in our climate.
And I don't want to argue about the causes.
What I want to argue about is, how are we going to get there to positively affect the impacts?
We have got to clean up this planet.
We have got to encourage other nations also to come along with us with the impacts of climate change, what we can do about that.
As governor, I was the first governor to form a climate change sub-cabinet to start dealing with the impacts.
We've got to reduce emissions.
John McCain is right there with an "all of the above" approach to deal with climate change impacts.
We've got to become energy independent for that reason.
Also as we rely more and more on other countries that don't care as much about the climate as we do, we're allowing them to produce and to emit and even pollute more than America would ever stand for.
So even in dealing with climate change, it's all the more reason that we have an "all of the above" approach, tapping into alternative sources of energy and conserving fuel, conserving our petroleum products and our hydrocarbons so that we can clean up this planet and deal with climate change.
Senator, what is true and what is false about the causes?
Well, I think it is manmade.
I think it's clearly manmade.
And, look, this probably explains the biggest fundamental difference between John McCain and Barack Obama and Sarah Palin and Joe Biden -- Governor Palin and Joe Biden.If you don't understand what the cause is, it's virtually impossible to come up with a solution.
We know what the cause is.
The cause is manmade.
That's the cause.
That's why the polar icecap is melting.
Now, let's look at the facts.
We have 3 percent of the world's oil reserves.
We consume 25 percent of the oil in the world.
John McCain has voted 20 times in the last decade-and-a-half against funding alternative energy sources, clean energy sources, wind, solar, biofuels.
The way in which we can stop the greenhouse gases from emitting.
We believe -- Barack Obama believes by investing in clean coal and safe nuclear, we can not only create jobs in wind and solar here in the United States, we can export it.
China is building one to three new coal-fired plants burning dirty coal per week.
It's polluting not only the atmosphere but the West Coast of the United States.
We should export the technology by investing in clean coal technology.
We should be creating jobs.
John McCain has voted 20 times against funding alternative energy sources and thinks, I guess, the only answer is drill, drill, drill.
Drill we must, but it will take 10 years for one drop of oil to come out of any of the wells that are going to begun to be drilled.
In the meantime, we're all going to be in real trouble.
Let me clear something up, Senator McCain has said he supports caps on carbon emissions.
Senator Obama has said he supports clean coal technology, which I don't believe you've always supported.
I have always supported it.
That's a fact.
Well, clear it up for us, both of you, and start with Governor Palin.
Yes, Senator McCain does support this.
The chant is "drill, baby, drill."
And that's what we hear all across this country in our rallies because people are so hungry for those domestic sources of energy to be tapped into.
They know that even in my own energy-producing state we have billions of barrels of oil and hundreds of trillions of cubic feet of clean, green natural gas.
And we're building a nearly $40 billion natural gas pipeline which is North America's largest and most you expensive infrastructure project ever to flow those sources of energy into hungry markets.Barack Obama and Senator Biden, you've said no to everything in trying to find a domestic solution to the energy crisis that we're in.
You even called drilling -- safe, environmentally-friendly drilling offshore as raping the outer continental shelf.
There -- with new technology, with tiny footprints even on land, it is safe to drill and we need to do more of that.
But also in that "all of the above" approach that Senator McCain supports, the alternative fuels will be tapped into: the nuclear, the clean coal.
I was surprised to hear you mention that because you had said that there isn't anything -- such a thing as clean coal.
And I think you said it in a rope line, too, at one of your rallies.
We do need to keep within our two minutes.
But I just wanted to ask you, do you support capping carbon emissions?
I do.
I do.
OK. And on the clean coal issue?
Absolutely.
Absolutely we do.
We call for setting hard targets, number one...
Clean coal.
Oh, I'm sorry.
On clean coal.
Oh, on clean coal.
My record, just take a look at the record.
My record for 25 years has supported clean coal technology.
A comment made in a rope line was taken out of context.
I was talking about exporting that technology to China so when they burn their dirty coal, it won't be as dirty, it will be clean.But here's the bottom line, Gwen: How do we deal with global warming with continued addition to carbon emissions?
And if the only answer you have is oil, and John -- and the governor says John is for everything.
Well, why did John vote 20 times?
Maybe he's for everything as long as it's not helped forward by the government.
Maybe he's for everything if the free market takes care of it.
I don't know.
But he voted 20 times against funding alternative energy sources.
The next round of -- pardon me, the next round of questions starts with you, Senator Biden.
Do you support, as they do in Alaska, granting same-sex benefits to couples?
Absolutely.
Do I support granting same-sex benefits?
Absolutely positively.
Look, in an Obama-Biden administration, there will be absolutely no distinction from a constitutional standpoint or a legal standpoint between a same-sex and a heterosexual couple.The fact of the matter is that under the Constitution we should be granted -- same-sex couples should be able to have visitation rights in the hospitals, joint ownership of property, life insurance policies, et cetera.
That's only fair.
It's what the Constitution calls for.
And so we do support it.
We do support making sure that committed couples in a same-sex marriage are guaranteed the same constitutional benefits as it relates to their property rights, their rights of visitation, their rights to insurance, their rights of ownership as heterosexual couples do.
Governor, would you support expanding that beyond Alaska to the rest of the nation?
Well, not if it goes closer and closer towards redefining the traditional definition of marriage between one man and one woman.
And unfortunately that's sometimes where those steps lead.But I also want to clarify, if there's any kind of suggestion at all from my answer that I would be anything but tolerant of adults in America choosing their partners, choosing relationships that they deem best for themselves, you know, I am tolerant and I have a very diverse family and group of friends and even within that group you would see some who may not agree with me on this issue, some very dear friends who don't agree with me on this issue.
But in that tolerance also, no one would ever propose, not in a McCain-Palin administration, to do anything to prohibit, say, visitations in a hospital or contracts being signed, negotiated between parties.
But I will tell Americans straight up that I don't support defining marriage as anything but between one man and one woman, and I think through nuances we can go round and round about what that actually means.
But I'm being as straight up with Americans as I can in my non- support for anything but a traditional definition of marriage.
Let's try to avoid nuance, Senator.
Do you support gay marriage?
No.
Barack Obama nor I support redefining from a civil side what constitutes marriage.
We do not support that.
That is basically the decision to be able to be able to be left to faiths and people who practice their faiths the determination what you call it.The bottom line though is, and I'm glad to hear the governor, I take her at her word, obviously, that she think there should be no civil rights distinction, none whatsoever, between a committed gay couple and a committed heterosexual couple.
If that's the case, we really don't have a difference.
Is that what your said?
Your question to him was whether he supported gay marriage and my answer is the same as his and it is that I do not.
Wonderful.
You agree.
On that note, let's move to foreign policy.
(LAUGHTER)
You both have sons who are in Iraq or on their way to Iraq.
You, Governor Palin, have said that you would like to see a real clear plan for an exit strategy.
What should that be, Governor?
I am very thankful that we do have a good plan and the surge and the counterinsurgency strategy in Iraq that has proven to work, I am thankful that that is part of the plan implemented under a great American hero, General Petraeus, and pushed hard by another great American, Senator John McCain.I know that the other ticket opposed this surge, in fact, even opposed funding for our troops in Iraq and Afghanistan.
Barack Obama voted against funding troops there after promising that he would not do so.
And Senator Biden, I respected you when you called him out on that.
You said that his vote was political and you said it would cost lives.
And Barack Obama at first said he would not do that.
He turned around under political pressure and he voted against funding the troops.
We do have a plan for withdrawal.
We don't need early withdrawal out of Iraq.
We cannot afford to lose there or we're going to be no better off in the war in Afghanistan either.
We have got to win in Iraq.And with the surge that has worked we're now down to presurge numbers in Iraq.
That's where we can be.
We can start putting more troops in Afghanistan as we also work with our NATO allies who are there strengthening us and we need to grow our military.
We cannot afford to lose against al Qaeda and the Shia extremists who are still there, still fighting us, but we're getting closer and closer to victory.
And it would be a travesty if we quit now in Iraq.
Senator?
Gwen, with all due respect, I didn't hear a plan.
Barack Obama has offered a clear plan.
Shift responsibility to the Iraqis over the next 16 months.
Draw down our combat troops.
Ironically the same plan that Maliki, the prime minister of Iraq and George Bush are now negotiating.
The only odd man out here, only one left out is John McCain, number one.
Number two, with regard to Barack Obama
