in Iraq and Pakistan and now in Darfur, putting U.S. troops on the ground.
Boots on the ground.
Is this something the American public has the stomach for?
I think the American public has the stomach for success.
My recommendations on Bosnia.
I admit I was the first one to recommend it.
They saved tens of thousands of lives.
And initially John McCain opposed it along with a lot of other people.
But the end result was it worked.
Look what we did in Bosnia.
We took Serbs, Croats and Bosniaks, being told by everyone, I was told by everyone that this would mean that they had been fighting and killing each other for a thousand years, it would never work.There's a relatively stable government there now as there is in Kosovo.
With regard to Iraq, I indicated that it would be a mistake to -- I gave the president the power.
I voted for the power because he said he needed it not to go to war but to keep the United States, the UN in line, to keep sanctions on Iraq and not let them be lifted.
I, along with Dick Lugar, before we went to war, said if we were to go to war without our allies, without the kind of support we need, we'd be there for a decade and it'd cost us tens of billions of dollars.
John McCain said, no, it was going to be OK.
I don't have the stomach for genocide when it comes to Darfur.
We can now impose a no-fly zone.
It's within our capacity.
We can lead NATO if we're willing to take a hard stand.
We can, I've been in those camps in Chad.
I've seen the suffering, thousands and tens of thousands have died and are dying.
We should rally the world to act and we should demonstrate it by our own movement to provide the helicopters to get the 21,000 forces of the African Union in there now to stop this genocide.
Thank you, senator.
Governor.
Oh, yeah, it's so obvious I'm a Washington outsider.
And someone just not used to the way you guys operate.
Because here you voted for the war and now you oppose the war.
You're one who says, as so many politicians do, I was for it before I was against it or vice- versa.
Americans are craving that straight talk and just want to know, hey, if you voted for it, tell us why you voted for it and it was a war resolution.And you had supported John McCain's military strategies pretty adamantly until this race and you had opposed very adamantly Barack Obama's military strategy, including cutting off funding for the troops that attempt all through the primary.
And I watched those debates, so I remember what those were all about.
But as for as Darfur, we can agree on that also, the supported of the no-fly zone, making sure that all options are on the table there also.
America is in a position to help.
What I've done in my position to help, as the governor of a state that's pretty rich in natural resources, we have a $40 billion investment fund, a savings fund called the Alaska Permanent Fund.
When I and others in the legislature found out we had some millions of dollars in Sudan, we called for divestment through legislation of those dollars to make sure we weren't doing anything that would be seen as condoning the activities there in Darfur.
That legislation hasn't passed yet but it needs to because all of us, as individuals, and as humanitarians and as elected officials should do all we can to end those atrocities in that region of the world.
Is there a line that should be drawn about when we decide to go in?
Absolutely.
There is a line that should be drawn.
What is it?
The line that should be drawn is whether we A, first of all have the capacity to do anything about it number one.
And number two, there are certain new lines that have to be drawn internationally.
When a country engages in genocide, when a country engaging in harboring terrorists and will do nothing about it, at that point that country in my view and Barack's view forfeits their right to say you have no right to intervene at all.The truth of the matter is, though, let's go back to John McCain's strategy.
I never supported John McCain's strategy on the war.
John McCain said exactly what Dick Cheney said, go back and look at Barack Obama's statements and mine.
Go look at joebiden.com, contemporaneously, held hearings in the summer before we went to war, saying if we went to war, we would not be greeted as liberator, we would have a fight between Sunnis and Shias, we would be tied down for a decade and cost us hundreds of billions of dollars.
John McCain was saying the exact opposite.
John McCain was lock- step with Dick Cheney at that point how this was going to be easy.
So John McCain's strategy in this war, not just whether or not to go, the actual conduct of the war has been absolutely wrong from the outset.
Governor.
I beg to disagree with you, again, here on whether you supported Barack Obama or John McCain's strategies.
Here again, you can say what you want to say a month out before people are asked to vote on this, but we listened to the debates.I think tomorrow morning, the pundits are going to start do the who said what at what time and we'll have proof of some of this, but, again, John McCain who knows how to win a war.
Who's been there and he's faced challenges and he knows what evil is and knows what it takes to overcome the challenges here with our military.
He knows to learn from the mistakes and blunders we have seen in the war in Iraq, especially.
He will know how to implement the strategies, working with our commanders and listening to what they have to say, taking the politics out of these war issues.
He'll know how to win a war.
Thank you, governor.Probably the biggest cliche about the vice-presidency is that it's a heartbeat away, everybody's waiting to see what would happen if the worst happened.
How would -- you disagree on some things from your principles, you disagree on drilling in Alaska, the National Wildlife Refuge, you disagree on the surveillance law, at least you have in the past.
How would a Biden administration be different from an Obama administration if that were to happen.
God forbid that would ever happen, it would be a national tragedy of historic proportions if it were to happen.But if it did, I would carry out Barack Obama's policies, his policies of reinstating the middle class, making sure they get a fair break, making sure they have access to affordable health insurance, making sure they get serious tax breaks, making sure we can help their children get to college, making sure there is an energy policy that leads us in the direction of not only toward independence and clean environment but an energy policy that creates 5 million new jobs, a foreign policy that ends this war in Iraq, a foreign policy that goes after the one mission the American public gave the president after 9/11, to get and capture or kill bin Laden and to eliminate al Qaeda.
A policy that would in fact engage our allies in making sure that we knew we were acting on the same page and not dictating.
And a policy that would reject the Bush Doctrine of preemption and regime change and replace it with a doctrine of prevention and cooperation and, ladies and gentlemen, this is the biggest ticket item that we have in this election.
This is the most important election you will ever, ever have voted in, any of you, since 1932.
And there's such stark differences, I would follow through on Barack's policies because in essence, I agree with every major initiative he is suggesting.
Governor.
And heaven forbid, yes, that would ever happen, no matter how this ends up, that that would ever happen with either party.As for disagreeing with John McCain and how our administration would work, what do you expect?
A team of mavericks, of course we're not going to agree on 100 percent of everything.
As we discuss ANWR there, at least we can agree to disagree on that one.
I will keep pushing him on ANWR.
I have so appreciated he has never asked me to check my opinions at the door and he wants a deliberative debate and healthy debate so we can make good policy.
What I would do also, if that were to ever happen, though, is to continue the good work he is so committed to of putting government back on the side of the people and get rid of the greed and corruption on Wall Street and in Washington.
I think we need a little bit of reality from Wasilla Main Street there, brought to Washington, DC.
So that people there can understand how the average working class family is viewing bureaucracy in the federal government and Congress, and the inaction of Congress.Just everyday, working-class Americans saying, you know, government, just get out of my way.
If you're going to do any harm and mandate more things on me and take more of my money and income tax and business taxes, you're going to have a choice in just a few weeks here on either supporting a ticket that wants to create jobs and bolster our economy and win the war or you're going to be supporting a ticket that wants to increase taxes, which ultimately kills jobs, and is going to hurt our economy.
Can I respond?
Look, all you've got to do is go down Union Street with me in Wilmington or go to Katie's Restaurant or walk into Home Depot with me where I spend a lot of time and you ask anybody in there whether or not the economic and foreign policy of this administration has made them better off in the last eight years.
And then ask them whether there's a single major initiative that John McCain differs with the president on.
On taxes, on Iraq, on Afghanistan, on the whole question of how to help education, on the dealing with health care.Look, the people in my neighborhood, they get it.
They get it.
They know they've been getting the short end of the stick.
So walk with me in my neighborhood, go back to my old neighborhood in Claymont, an old steel town or go up to Scranton with me.
These people know the middle class has gotten the short end.
The wealthy have done very well.
Corporate America has been rewarded.
It's time we change it.
Barack Obama will change it.
Governor?
Say it ain't so, Joe, there you go again pointing backwards again.
You prefaced your whole comment with the Bush administration.
Now doggone it, let's look ahead and tell Americans what we have to plan to do for them in the future.
You mentioned education and I'm glad that you did.
I know education you are passionate about with your wife being a teacher for 30 years, and god bless her.
Her reward is in heaven, right?
I say, too, with education, America needs to be putting a lot more focus on that and our schools have got to be really ramped up in terms of the funding that they are deserving.
Teachers needed to be paid more.
I come from a house full of school teachers.
My grandma was, my dad who is in the audience today, he's a schoolteacher, had been for many years.
My brother, who I think is the best schoolteacher in the year, and here's a shout-out to all those third graders at Gladys Wood Elementary School, you get extra credit for watching this debate.Education in America has been in some sense in some of our states just accepted to be a little bit lax, and we have got to increase the standards.
No Child Left Behind was implemented.
It's not doing the job though.
We need flexibility in No Child Left Behind.
We need to put more of an emphasis on the profession of teaching.
We need to make sure that education in either one of our agendas, I think, absolute top of the line.
My kids as public school participants right now, it's near and dear to my heart.
I'm very, very concerned about where we're going with education and we have got to ramp it up and put more attention in that arena.
Everybody gets extra credit tonight.
We're going to move on to the next question.
Governor, you said in July that someone would have to explain to you exactly what it is the vice president does every day.
You, senator, said, you would not be vice president under any circumstances.
Now maybe this was just what was going on at the time.
But tell us now, looking forward, what it is you think the vice presidency is worth now.
In my comment there, it was a lame attempt at a joke and yours was a lame attempt at a joke, too, I guess, because nobody got it.
Of course we know what a vice president does.
They didn't get yours or mine?
Which one didn't they get?
No, no.
Of course, we know what a vice president does.
And that's not only to preside over the Senate and will take that position very seriously also.
I'm thankful that the Constitution would allow a bit more authority given to the vice president also if that vice president so chose to exert it in working with the Senate and making sure that we are supportive of the president's policies and making sure too that our president understands what our strengths are.
John McCain and I have had good conversations about where I would lead with his agenda, and that is energy independence in America and reform of government over all, and then working with families of children with special needs.
That's near and dear to my heart also.
And in those arenas, John McCain has already tapped me and said, that's where I want you, I want you to lead.
And I said, I can't wait to get there and go to work with you.
Senator?
Gwen, I hope we'll get back to education because I don't know any government program that John is supporting, not early education, more money for it.
The reason No Child Left Behind was left behind was the money was left behind, we didn't fund it.
But we can get back to that I assume.With regard to the role of vice president, I had a long talk, as I'm sure the governor did with her principal, in my case with Barack.
And let me tell you what Barack asked me to do.
I have a history of getting things done in the United States Senate.
John McCain would acknowledge that.
My record shows that on controversial issues.
I would be the point person for the legislative initiatives in the United States Congress for our administration.
I would also, when asked if I wanted a portfolio, my response was, no.
But Barack Obama indicated to me he wanted me with him to help him govern.
So every major decision he'll be making, I'll be sitting in the room to give him my best advice.
He's president, not me, I'll give my best advice.
And one of the things he said early on when he was choosing, he said he picked someone who had an independent judgment and wouldn't be afraid to tell him if he disagreed.
That is sort of my reputation, as you know.
So I look forward to working with Barack and playing a very constructive role in his presidency, bringing about the kind of change this country needs.
Governor, you mentioned a moment ago that the Constitution might give the vice president more power than it has in the past.
Do you believe as Vice President Cheney does, that the Executive Branch does not hold complete sway over the office of the vice presidency, that it it is also a member of the Legislative Branch?
Well, our founding fathers were very wise there in allowing through the Constitution much flexibility there in the Office of the Vice President.
And we will do what is best for the American people in tapping into that position and ushering in an agenda that is supportive and cooperative with the president's agenda in that position.
Yeah, so I do agree with him that we have a lot of flexibility in there, and we'll do what we have to do to administer very appropriately the plans that are needed for this nation.And it is my executive experience that is partly to be attributed to my pick as V.P.
with McCain, not only as a governor, but earlier on as a mayor, as an oil and gas regulator, as a business owner.
It is those years of experience on an executive level that will be put to good use in the White House also.
Vice President Cheney's interpretation of the vice presidency?
Vice President Cheney has been the most dangerous vice president we've had probably in American history.
The idea he doesn't realize that Article I of the Constitution defines the role of the vice president of the United States, that's the Executive Branch.
He works in the Executive Branch.
He should understand that.
Everyone should understand that.And the primary role of the vice president of the United States of America is to support the president of the United States of America, give that president his or her best judgment when sought, and as vice president, to preside over the Senate, only in a time when in fact there's a tie vote.
The Constitution is explicit.
The only authority the vice president has from the legislative standpoint is the vote, only when there is a tie vote.
He has no authority relative to the Congress.
The idea he's part of the Legislative Branch is a bizarre notion invented by Cheney to aggrandize the power of a unitary executive and look where it has gotten us.
It has been very dangerous.
Let's talk conventional wisdom for a moment.
The conventional wisdom, Governor Palin, with you, is that your Achilles heel is that you lack experience.
Your conventional wisdom against you is that your Achilles heel is that you lack discipline, Senator Biden.
What is it really for you, Governor Palin?
What is it really for you, Senator Biden?
Start with you, governor.
My experience as an executive will be put to good use as a mayor and business owner and oil and gas regulator and then as governor of a huge state, a huge energy-producing state that is accounting for much progress towards getting our nation energy independence and that's extremely important.But it wasn't just that experience tapped into, it was my connection to the heartland of America.
Being a mom, being one who is very concerned about a son in the war, about a special needs child, about kids heading off to college, how are we going to pay those tuition bills?
About times and Todd and our marriage in our past where we didn't have health insurance and we know what other Americans are going through as they sit around the kitchen table and try to figure out, how are they going to pay out-of-pocket for health care?
We've been there also so that connection was important.
But even more important is that worldview that I share with John McCain.
That worldview that says that America is a nation of exceptionalism.
And we are to be that shining city on a hill, as President Reagan so beautifully said, that we are a beacon of hope and that we are unapologetic here.
We are not perfect as a nation.
But together, we represent a perfect ideal, and that is democracy and tolerance and freedom and equal rights.
Those things that we stand for that can be put to good use as a force for good in this world.
John McCain and I share that, and you combine all that with being a team with the only track record of making a really, a difference in where we've been and reforming, and that's a good team, it's a good ticket.
Senator?
You're very kind suggesting my only Achilles heel is my lack of discipline.
Others talk about my excessive passion.
I'm not going to change.
I have 35 years in public office.
People can judge who I am.
I haven't changed in that time.And, by the way, a record of change -- I will place my record and Barack's record against John McCain's or anyone else in terms of fundamental accomplishments.
Wrote the crime bill, put 100,000 cops on the street, wrote the Violence Against Women Act, which John McCain voted against both of them, was the catalyst to change the circumstance in Bosnia, led by President Clinton, obviously.
Look, I understand what it's like to be a single parent.
When my wife and daughter died and my two sons were gravely injured, I understand what it's like as a parent to wonder what it's like if your kid's going to make it.
I understand what it's like to sit around the kitchen table with a father who says, "I've got to leave, champ, because there's no jobs here.
I got to head down to Wilmington.
And when we get enough money, honey, we'll bring you down."
I understand what it's like.
I'm much better off than almost all Americans now.
I get a good salary with the United States Senate.
I live in a beautiful house that's my total investment that I have.
So I -- I am much better off now.
But the notion that somehow, because I'm a man, I don't know what it's like to raise two kids alone, I don't know what it's like to have a child you're not sure is going to -- is going to make it -- I understand.
I understand, as well as, with all due respect, the governor or anybody else, what it's like for those people sitting around that kitchen table.
And guess what?
They're looking for help.
They're looking for help.
They're not looking for more of the same.
Governor?
People aren't looking for more of the same.
They are looking for change.
And John
