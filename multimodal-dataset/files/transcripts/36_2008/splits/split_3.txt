In fact, what, Joe, if you want to do the right thing with your employees and you want to provide them health insurance, we'll give you a 50 percent credit so that you will actually be able to afford it.
If you don't have health insurance or you want to buy into a group plan, you will be able to buy into the plan that I just described.
Now, what we haven't talked about is Senator McCain's plan.
He says he's going to give you all a $5,000 tax credit.
That sounds pretty good.
And you can go out and buy your own insurance.
Here's the problem -- that for about 20 million people, you may find yourselves no longer having employer-based health insurance.
This is because younger people might be able to get health insurance for $5,000, young and healthy folks.
Older folks, less healthy folks, what's going to end up happening is that you're going to be the only ones left in your employer-based system, your employers won't be able to afford it.
And once you're out on your own with this $5,000 credit, Senator McCain, for the first time, is going to be taxing the health care benefits that you have from your employer.
And this is your plan, John.
For the first time in history, you will be taxing people's health care benefits.
By the way, the average policy costs about $12,000.
So if you've got $5,000 and it's going to cost you $12,000, that's a loss for you.
Last point about Senator McCain's plan is that insurers right now, the main restrictions on what they do is primarily state law and, under Senator McCain's plan, those rules would be stripped away and you would start seeing a lot more insurance companies cherry-picking and excluding people from coverage.
That, I think, is a mistake and I think that this is a fundamental difference in our campaign and how we would approach health care.
What about that?
Hey, Joe, you're rich, congratulations, because what Joe wanted to do was buy the business that he's been working for 10-12 hours a day, seven days a week, and you said that you wanted to spread the wealth, but -- in other words, take Joe's money and then you decide what to do with it.
Now, Joe, you're rich, congratulations, and you will then fall into the category where you'll have to pay a fine if you don't provide health insurance that Senator Obama mandates, not the kind that you think is best for your family, your children, your employees, but the kind that he mandates for you.
That's big government at its best.
Now, 95 percent of the people in America will receive more money under my plan because they will receive not only their present benefits, which may be taxed, which will be taxed, but then you add $5,000 onto it, except for those people who have the gold-plated Cadillac insurance policies that have to do with cosmetic surgery and transplants and all of those kinds of things.
And the good thing about this is they'll be able to go across America.
The average cost of a health care insurance plan in America today is $5,800.
I'm going to give them $5,000 to take with them wherever they want to go, and this will give them affordability.
This will give them availability.
This will give them a chance to choose their own futures, not have Senator Obama and government decide that for them.
This really gets down to the fundamental difference in our philosophies.
If you notice that in all of this proposal, Senator -- government wants -- Senator Obama wants government to do the job.
Senator Obama wants government to do the job.
I want, Joe, you to do the job.
I want to leave money in your pocket.
I want you to be able to choose the health care for you and your family.
That's what I'm all about.
And we've got too much government and too much spending and the government is -- the size of government has grown by 40 percent in the last eight years.
We can't afford that in the next eight years and Senator Obama, with the Democrats in charge of Congress, things have gotten worse.
Have you noticed, they've been in charge the last two years.
All right.
A short response.
Very briefly.
You all just heard my plan.
If you've got an employer-based health care plan, you keep it.
Now, under Senator McCain's plan there is a strong risk that people would lose their employer-based health care.
That's the choice you'll have is having your employer no longer provide you health care.
And don't take my word for it.
The U.S. Chamber of Commerce, which generally doesn't support a lot of Democrats, said that this plan could lead to the unraveling of the employer-based health care system.
All I want to do, if you've already got health care, is lower your costs.
That includes you, Joe.
All right.
Let's stop there and go to another question.
And this one goes to Senator McCain.
Senator McCain, you believe Roe v. Wade should be overturned.
Senator Obama, you believe it shouldn't.
Could either of you ever nominate someone to the Supreme Court who disagrees with you on this issue?
Senator McCain?
I would never and have never in all the years I've been there imposed a litmus test on any nominee to the court.
That's not appropriate to do.
But you don't want Roe v. Wade to be overturned?
I thought it was a bad decision.
I think there were a lot of decisions that were bad.
I think that decisions should rest in the hands of the states.
I'm a federalist.
And I believe strongly that we should have nominees to the United States Supreme Court based on their qualifications rather than any litmus test.
Now, let me say that there was a time a few years ago when the United States Senate was about to blow up.
Republicans wanted to have just a majority vote to confirm a judge and the Democrats were blocking in an unprecedented fashion.
We got together seven Republicans, seven Democrats.
You were offered a chance to join.
You chose not to because you were afraid of the appointment of, quote, "conservative judges."
I voted for Justice Breyer and Justice Ginsburg.
Not because I agreed with their ideology, but because I thought they were qualified and that elections have consequences when presidents are nominated.
This is a very important issue we're talking about.
Senator Obama voted against Justice Breyer and Justice Roberts on the grounds that they didn't meet his ideological standards.
That's not the way we should judge these nominees.
Elections have consequences.
They should be judged on their qualifications.
And so that's what I will do.
I will find the best people in the world -- in the United States of America who have a history of strict adherence to the Constitution.
And not legislating from the bench.
But even if it was someone -- even someone who had a history of being for abortion rights, you would consider them?
I would consider anyone in their qualifications.
I do not believe that someone who has supported Roe v. Wade that would be part of those qualifications.
But I certainly would not impose any litmus test.
All right.
Well, I think it's true that we shouldn't apply a strict litmus test and the most important thing in any judge is their capacity to provide fairness and justice to the American people.
And it is true that this is going to be, I think, one of the most consequential decisions of the next president.
It is very likely that one of us will be making at least one and probably more than one appointments and Roe versus Wade probably hangs in the balance.
Now I would not provide a litmus test.
But I am somebody who believes that Roe versus Wade was rightly decided.
I think that abortion is a very difficult issue and it is a moral issue and one that I think good people on both sides can disagree on.
But what ultimately I believe is that women in consultation with their families, their doctors, their religious advisers, are in the best position to make this decision.
And I think that the Constitution has a right to privacy in it that shouldn't be subject to state referendum, any more than our First Amendment rights are subject to state referendum, any more than many of the other rights that we have should be subject to popular vote.
So this is going to be an important issue.
I will look for those judges who have an outstanding judicial record, who have the intellect, and who hopefully have a sense of what real-world folks are going through.
I'll just give you one quick example.
Senator McCain and I disagreed recently when the Supreme Court made it more difficult for a woman named Lilly Ledbetter to press her claim for pay discrimination.
For years, she had been getting paid less than a man had been paid for doing the exact same job.
And when she brought a suit, saying equal pay for equal work, the judges said, well, you know, it's taken you too long to bring this lawsuit, even though she didn't know about it until fairly recently.
We tried to overturn it in the Senate.
I supported that effort to provide better guidance to the courts; John McCain opposed it.
I think that it's important for judges to understand that if a woman is out there trying to raise a family, trying to support her family, and is being treated unfairly, then the court has to stand up, if nobody else will.
And that's the kind of judge that I want.
Time's up.
Obviously, that law waived the statute of limitations, which you could have gone back 20 or 30 years.
It was a trial lawyer's dream.
Let me talk to you about an important aspect of this issue.
We have to change the culture of America.
Those of us who are proudly pro-life understand that.
And it's got to be courage and compassion that we show to a young woman who's facing this terribly difficult decision.
Senator Obama, as a member of the Illinois State Senate, voted in the Judiciary Committee against a law that would provide immediate medical attention to a child born of a failed abortion.
He voted against that.
And then, on the floor of the State Senate, as he did 130 times as a state senator, he voted present.
Then there was another bill before the Senate Judiciary Committee in the state of Illinois not that long ago, where he voted against a ban on partial-birth abortion, one of the late-term abortion, a really -- one of the bad procedures, a terrible.
And then, on the floor of the Illinois State Senate, he voted present.
I don't know how you vote "present" on some of that.
I don't know how you align yourself with the extreme aspect of the pro- abortion movement in America.
And that's his record, and that's a matter of his record.
And he'll say it has something to do with Roe v. Wade, about the Illinois State Senate.
It was clear-cut votes that Senator Obama voted, I think, in direct contradiction to the feelings and views of mainstream America.
Response?
Yes, let me respond to this.
If it sounds incredible that I would vote to withhold lifesaving treatment from an infant, that's because it's not true.
The -- here are the facts.
There was a bill that was put forward before the Illinois Senate that said you have to provide lifesaving treatment and that would have helped to undermine Roe v. Wade.
The fact is that there was already a law on the books in Illinois that required providing lifesaving treatment, which is why not only myself but pro-choice Republicans and Democrats voted against it.
And the Illinois Medical Society, the organization of doctors in Illinois, voted against it.
Their Hippocratic Oath would have required them to provide care, and there was already a law in the books.
With respect to partial-birth abortion, I am completely supportive of a ban on late-term abortions, partial-birth or otherwise, as long as there's an exception for the mother's health and life, and this did not contain that exception.
And I attempted, as many have in the past, of including that so that it is constitutional.
And that was rejected, and that's why I voted present, because I'm willing to support a ban on late-term abortions as long as we have that exception.
The last point I want to make on the issue of abortion.
This is an issue that -- look, it divides us.
And in some ways, it may be difficult to -- to reconcile the two views.
But there surely is some common ground when both those who believe in choice and those who are opposed to abortion can come together and say, "We should try to prevent unintended pregnancies by providing appropriate education to our youth, communicating that sexuality is sacred and that they should not be engaged in cavalier activity, and providing options for adoption, and helping single mothers if they want to choose to keep the baby."
Those are all things that we put in the Democratic platform for the first time this year, and I think that's where we can find some common ground, because nobody's pro-abortion.
I think it's always a tragic situation.
We should try to reduce these circumstances.
Let's give Senator McCain a short response...
Just again...
... and then...
Just again, the example of the eloquence of Senator Obama.
He's health for the mother.
You know, that's been stretched by the pro-abortion movement in America to mean almost anything.
That's the extreme pro-abortion position, quote, "health."
But, look, Cindy and I are adoptive parents.
We know what a treasure and joy it is to have an adopted child in our lives.
We'll do everything we can to improve adoption in this country.
But that does not mean that we will cease to protect the rights of the unborn.
Of course, we have to come together.
Of course, we have to work together, and, of course, it's vital that we do so and help these young women who are facing such a difficult decision, with a compassion, that we'll help them with the adoptive services, with the courage to bring that child into this world and we'll help take care of it.
Let's stop there, because I want to get in a question on education and I'm afraid this is going to have to be our last question, gentlemen.
The question is this: the U.S. spends more per capita than any other country on education.
Yet, by every international measurement, in math and science competence, from kindergarten through the 12th grade, we trail most of the countries of the world.
The implications of this are clearly obvious.
Some even say it poses a threat to our national security.
Do you feel that way and what do you intend to do about it?
The question to Senator Obama first.
This probably has more to do with our economic future than anything and that means it also has a national security implication, because there's never been a nation on earth that saw its economy decline and continued to maintain its primacy as a military power.
So we've got to get our education system right.
Now, typically, what's happened is that there's been a debate between more money or reform, and I think we need both.
In some cases, we are going to have to invest.
Early childhood education, which closes the achievement gap, so that every child is prepared for school, every dollar we invest in that, we end up getting huge benefits with improved reading scores, reduced dropout rates, reduced delinquency rates.
I think it's going to be critically important for us to recruit a generation of new teachers, an army of new teachers, especially in math and science, give them higher pay, give them more professional development and support in exchange for higher standards and accountability.
And I think it's important for us to make college affordable.
Right now, I meet young people all across the country who either have decided not to go to college or if they're going to college, they are taking on $20,000, $30,000, $50,000, $60,000 worth of debt, and it's very difficult for them to go into some fields, like basic research in science, for example, thinking to themselves that they're going to have a mortgage before they even buy a house.
And that's why I've proposed a $4,000 tuition credit, every student, every year, in exchange for some form of community service, whether it's military service, whether it's Peace Corps, whether it's working in a community.
If we do those things, then I believe that we can create a better school system.
But there's one last ingredient that I just want to mention, and that's parents.
We can't do it just in the schools.
Parents are going to have to show more responsibility.
They've got to turn off the TV set, put away the video games, and, finally, start instilling that thirst for knowledge that our students need.
Senator McCain?
Well, it's the civil rights issue of the 21st century.
There's no doubt that we have achieved equal access to schools in America after a long and difficult and terrible struggle.
But what is the advantage in a low income area of sending a child to a failed school and that being your only choice?
So choice and competition amongst schools is one of the key elements that's already been proven in places in like New Orleans and New York City and other places, where we have charter schools, where we take good teachers and we reward them and promote them.
And we find bad teachers another line of work.
And we have to be able to give parents the same choice, frankly, that Senator Obama and Mrs. Obama had and Cindy and I had to send our kids to the school -- their kids to the school of their choice.
Charter schools aren't the only answer, but they're providing competition.
They are providing the kind of competitions that have upgraded both schools -- types of schools.
Now, throwing money at the problem is not the answer.
You will find that some of the worst school systems in America get the most money per student.
So I believe that we need to reward these good teachers.
We need to encourage programs such as Teach for America and Troops to Teachers where people, after having served in the military, can go right to teaching and not have to take these examinations which -- or have the certification that some are required in some states.
Look, we must improve education in this country.
As far as college education is concerned, we need to make those student loans available.
We need to give them a repayment schedule that they can meet.
We need to have full student loan program for in-state tuition.
And we certainly need to adjust the certain loan eligibility to inflation.
Do you think the federal government should play a larger role in the schools?
And I mean, more federal money?
Well, we have a tradition of local control of the schools and that's a tradition that has served us well.
But I do think that it is important for the federal government to step up and help local school districts do some of the things they need to do.
Now we tried to do this under President Bush.
He put forward No Child Left Behind.
Unfortunately, they left the money behind for No Child Left Behind.
And local school districts end up having more of a burden, a bunch of unfunded mandates, the same kind of thing that happened with special education where we did the right thing by saying every school should provide education to kids with special needs, but we never followed through on the promise of funding, and that left local school districts very cash-strapped.
So what I want to do is focus on early childhood education, providing teachers higher salaries in exchange for more support.
Senator McCain and I actually agree on two things that he just mentioned.
Charter schools, I doubled the number of charter schools in Illinois despite some reservations from teachers unions.
I think it's important to foster competition inside the public schools.
And we also agree on the need for making sure that if we have bad teachers that they are swiftly -- after given an opportunity to prove themselves, if they can't hack it, then we need to move on because our kids have to have their best future.
Where we disagree is on the idea that we can somehow give out vouchers -- give vouchers as a way of securing the problems in our education system.
And I also have to disagree on Senator McCain's record when it comes to college accessibility and affordability.
Recently his key economic adviser was asked about why he didn't seem to have some specific programs to help young people go to college and the response was, well, you know, we can't give money to every interest group that comes along.
I don't think America's youth are interest groups, I think they're our future.
And this is an example of where we are going to have to prioritize.
We can't say we're going to do things and then not explain in concrete terms how we're going to pay for it.
And if we're going to do some of the things you mentioned, like lowering loan rates or what have you, somebody has got to pay for it.
It's not going to happen on its own.
What about that, Senator?
Well, sure.
I'm sure you're aware, Senator Obama, of the program in the Washington, D.C., school system where vouchers are provided and there's a certain number, I think it's a thousand and some and some 9,000 parents asked to be eligible for that.
Because they wanted to have the same choice that you and I and Cindy and your wife have had.
And that is because they wanted to choose the school that they thought was best for their children.
And we all know the state of the Washington, D.C., school system.
That was vouchers.
That was vouchers, Senator Obama.
And I'm frankly surprised you didn't pay more attention to that example.
Now as far as the No Child Left Behind is concerned, it was a great first beginning in my view.
It had its flaws, it had its problems, the first time we had looked at the issue of education in America from a nationwide perspective.
And we need to fix a lot of the problems.
We need to sit down and reauthorize it.
But, again, spending more money isn't always the answer.
I think the Head Start program is a great program.
A lot of people, including me, said, look, it's not doing what it should do.
By the third grade many times children who were in the Head Start program aren't any better off than the others.
Let's reform it.
Let's reform it and fund it.
That was, of course, out-of-bounds by the Democrats.
We need to reform these programs.
We need to have transparency.
We need to have rewards.
It's a system that cries out for accountability and transparency and the adequate funding.
And I just said to you earlier, town hall meeting after town hall meeting, parents come with kids, children -- precious children who have autism.
Sarah Palin knows about that better than most.
And we'll find and we'll spend the money, research, to find the cause of autism.
And we'll care for these young children.
And all Americans will open their wallets and their hearts to do so.
But to have a situation, as you mentioned in our earlier comments, that the most expensive education in the world is in the United States of America also means that it cries out for reform, as well.
And I will support those reforms, and I will fund the ones that are reformed.
But I'm not going to continue to throw money at a problem.
And I've got to tell you that vouchers, where they are requested and where they are agreed to, are a good and workable system.
And it's been proven.
I'll just make a quick comment about vouchers in D.C.
Senator McCain's absolutely right: The D.C. school system is in terrible shape, and it has been for a very long time.
And we've got a wonderful new superintendent there who's working very hard with the young mayor there to try...
Who supports vouchers.
... who initiated -- actually, supports charters.
She supports vouchers, also.
But the -- but here's the thing, is that, even if Senator McCain were to say that vouchers were the way to go -- I disagree with him on this, because the data doesn't show that it actually solves the problem -- the centerpiece of Senator McCain's education policy is to increase the voucher program in D.C. by 2,000 slots.
That leaves all of you who live in the other 50 states without an education reform policy from Senator McCain.
So if we are going to be serious about this issue, we've got to have a president who is going to tackle it head-on.
And that's what I intend to do as president.
All right.
Because there's not enough vouchers; therefore, we shouldn't do it, even though it's working.
I got it.
All right.
Gentlemen, we have come to the close.
Before I ask both of you for your closing statements tonight, I'd like to invite our viewers and listeners to go to MyDebates.org, where you will find this evening's debates and the three that preceded tonight's debate.
Now, for the final statements, by a coin toss, Senator McCain goes first.
Well, thank you again, Bob.
Thanks to Hofstra.
And it's great to be with you again.
I think we've had a very healthy discussion.
My friends, as I said in my opening remarks, these are very difficult times and challenges for America.
And they were graphically demonstrated again today.
America needs a new direction.
We cannot be satisfied with what we've been doing for the last eight years.
I have a record of reform, and taking on my party, the other party, the special interests, whether it be an HMO Patients' Bill of Rights, or trying to clean up the campaign finance system in -- in this country, or whether it be establishment of a 9/11 Commission, I have a long record of it.
And I've been a careful steward of your tax dollars.
We have to make health care affordable and available.
We have to make quality education there for all of our citizens, not just the privileged few.
We have to stop the spending.
We have to stop the spending, which has mortgaged your children's futures.
All of these things and all the promises and commitments that Senator Obama and I made (inaudible) made to you tonight will base -- will be based on whether you can trust us or not to be careful stewards of your tax dollar, to make sure America is safe and secure and prosperous, to make sure we reform the institutions of government.
That's why I've asked you not only to examine my record, but my proposals for the future of this country.
I've spent my entire life in the service of this nation and putting my country first.
Thereâ€™s a long line of McCains that have served our country for a long time in war and in peace, it's been the great honor of my life, and I've been proud to serve.
And I hope you'll give me an opportunity to serve again.
I'd be honored and humbled.
Senator?
Well, I want to thank Senator McCain and Bob for moderating.
I think we all know America is going through tough times right now.
The policies of the last eight years and -- and Washington's unwillingness to tackle the tough problems for decades has left us in the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression.
And that's why the biggest risk we could take right now is to adopt the same failed policies and the same failed politics that we've seen over the last eight years and somehow expect a different result.
We need fundamental change in this country, and that's what I'd like to bring.
You know, over the last 20 months, you've invited me into your homes.
You've shared your stories with me.
And you've confirmed once again the fundamental decency and generosity of the American people.
And that's why I'm sure that our brighter days are still ahead.
But we're going to have to invest in the American people again, in tax cuts for the middle class, in health care for all Americans, and college for every young person who wants to go.
In businesses that can create the new energy economy of the future.
In policies that will lift wages and will grow our middle class.
These are the policies I have fought for my entire career.
And these are the policies I want to bring to the White House.
But it's not going to be easy.
It's not going to be quick.
It is going to be requiring all of us -- Democrats, Republicans, independents -- to come together and to renew a spirit of sacrifice and service and responsibility.
I'm absolutely convinced we can do it.
I would ask for your vote, and I promise you that if you give me the extraordinary honor of serving as your president, I will work every single day, tirelessly, on your behalf and on the behalf of the future of our children.
Thank you very much.
