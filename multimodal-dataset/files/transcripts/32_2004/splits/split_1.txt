is going to happen.
I've acknowledged that in union halls across the country.
I've had shop stewards stand up and say, "Will you promise me you're going to stop all this outsourcing?
"And I've looked them in the eye and I've said, "No, I can't do that. "
What I can promise you is that I will make the playing field as fair as possible, that I will, for instance, make certain that with respect to the tax system that you as a worker in America are not subsidizing the loss of your job.
Today, if you're an American business, you actually get a benefit for going overseas.
You get to defer your taxes.
So if you're looking at a competitive world, you say to yourself, "Hey, I do better overseas than I do here in America. "
That's not smart.
I don't want American workers subsidizing the loss of their own job.
And when I'm president, we're going to shut that loophole in a nanosecond and we're going to use that money to lower corporate tax rates in America for all corporations, 5 percent.
And we're going to have a manufacturing jobs credit and a job hiring credit so we actually help people be able to hire here.
The second thing that we can do is provide a fair trade playing field.
This president didn't stand up for Boeing when Airbus was violating international rules and subsidies.
He discovered Boeing during the course of this campaign after I'd been talking about it for months.
The fact is that the president had an opportunity to stand up and take on China for currency manipulation.
There are companies that wanted to petition the administration.
They were told: Don't even bother; we're not going to listen to it.
The fact is that there have been markets shut to us that we haven't stood up and fought for.
I'm going to fight for a fair trade playing field for the American worker.
And I will fight for the American worker just as hard as I fight for my own job.
That's what the American worker wants.
And if we do that, we can have an impact.
Plus, we need fiscal discipline.
Restore fiscal discipline, we'll do a lot better.
Mr. President?
Whew!
Let me start with the Pell Grants.
In his last litany of misstatements.
He said we cut Pell Grants.
We've increased Pell Grants by a million students.
That's a fact.
You know, he talks to the workers.
Let me talk to the workers.
You've got more money in your pocket as a result of the tax relief we passed and he opposed.
If you have a child, you got a $1,000 child credit.
That's money in your pocket.
If you're married, we reduced the marriage penalty.
The code ought to encourage marriage, not discourage marriage.
We created a 10 percent bracket to help lower-income Americans.
A family of four making $40,000 received about $1,700 in tax relief.
It's your money.
The way my opponent talks, he said, "We're going to spend the government's money.
"No, we're spending your money.
And when you have more money in your pocket, you're able to better afford things you want.
I believe the role of government is to stand side by side with our citizens to help them realize their dreams, not tell citizens how to live their lives.
My opponent talks about fiscal sanity.
His record in the United States Senate does not match his rhetoric.
He voted to increase taxes 98 times and to bust the budget 277 times.
Senator Kerry?
Bob, anybody can play with these votes.
Everybody knows that.
I have supported or voted for tax cuts over 600 times.
I broke with my party in order to balance the budget, and Ronald Reagan signed into law the tax cut that we voted for.
I voted for IRA tax cuts.
I voted for small-business tax cuts.
But you know why the Pell Grants have gone up in their numbers?
Because more people qualify for them because they don't have money.
But they're not getting the $5,100 the president promised them.
They're getting less money.
We have more people who qualify.
That's not what we want.
Senator, no one's playing with your votes.
You voted to increase taxes 98 times.
When they voted -- when they proposed reducing taxes, you voted against it 126 times.
He voted to violate the budget cap 277 times.
You know, there's a main stream in American politics and you sit right on the far left bank.
As a matter of fact, your record is such that Ted Kennedy, your colleague, is the conservative senator from Massachusetts.
Mr. President, let's get back to economic issues.
But let's shift to some other questions here.
Both of you are opposed to gay marriage.
But to understand how you have come to that conclusion, I want to ask you a more basic question.
Do you believe homosexuality is a choice?
You know, Bob, I don't know.
I just don't know.
I do know that we have a choice to make in America and that is to treat people with tolerance and respect and dignity.
It's important that we do that.
And I also know in a free society people, consenting adults can live the way they want to live.
And that's to be honored.
But as we respect someone's rights, and as we profess tolerance, we shouldn't change -- or have to change -- our basic views on the sanctity of marriage.
I believe in the sanctity of marriage.
I think it's very important that we protect marriage as an institution, between a man and a woman.
I proposed a constitutional amendment.
The reason I did so was because I was worried that activist judges are actually defining the definition of marriage, and the surest way to protect marriage between a man and woman is to amend the Constitution.
It has also the benefit of allowing citizens to participate in the process.
After all, when you amend the Constitution, state legislatures must participate in the ratification of the Constitution.
I'm deeply concerned that judges are making those decisions and not the citizenry of the United States.
You know, Congress passed a law called DOMA, the Defense of Marriage Act.
My opponent was against it.
It basically protected states from the action of one state to another.
It also defined marriage as between a man and woman.
But I'm concerned that that will get overturned.
And if it gets overturned, then we'll end up with marriage being defined by courts, and I don't think that's in our nation's interests.
Senator Kerry?
We're all God's children, Bob.
And I think if you were to talk to Dick Cheney's daughter, who is a lesbian, she would tell you that she's being who she was, she's being who she was born as.
I think if you talk to anybody, it's not choice.
I've met people who struggled with this for years, people who were in a marriage because they were living a sort of convention, and they struggled with it.
And I've met wives who are supportive of their husbands or vice versa when they finally sort of broke out and allowed themselves to live who they were, who they felt God had made them.
I think we have to respect that.
The president and I share the belief that marriage is between a man and a woman.
I believe that.
I believe marriage is between a man and a woman.
But I also believe that because we are the United States of America, we're a country with a great, unbelievable Constitution, with rights that we afford people, that you can't discriminate in the workplace.
You can't discriminate in the rights that you afford people.
You can't disallow someone the right to visit their partner in a hospital.
You have to allow people to transfer property, which is why I'm for partnership rights and so forth.
Now, with respect to DOMA and the marriage laws, the states have always been able to manage those laws.
And they're proving today, every state, that they can manage them adequately.
Senator Kerry, a new question for you.
The New York Times reports that some Catholic archbishops are telling their church members that it would be a sin to vote for a candidate like you because you support a woman's right to choose an abortion and unlimited stem-cell research.
What is your reaction to that?
I respect their views.
I completely respect their views.
I am a Catholic.
And I grew up learning how to respect those views.
But I disagree with them, as do many.
I believe that I can't legislate or transfer to another American citizen my article of faith.
What is an article of faith for me is not something that I can legislate on somebody who doesn't share that article of faith.
I believe that choice is a woman's choice.
It's between a woman, God and her doctor.
And that's why I support that.
Now, I will not allow somebody to come in and change Roe v. Wade.
The president has never said whether or not he would do that.
But we know from the people he's tried to appoint to the court he wants to.
I will not.
I will defend the right of Roe v. Wade.
Now, with respect to religion, you know, as I said, I grew up a Catholic.
I was an altar boy.
I know that throughout my life this has made a difference to me.
And as President Kennedy said when he ran for president, he said, "I'm not running to be a Catholic president.
I'm running to be a president who happens to be Catholic. "
My faith affects everything that I do, in truth.
There's a great passage of the Bible that says, "What does it mean, my brother, to say you have faith if there are no deeds?
Faith without works is dead. "
And I think that everything you do in public life has to be guided by your faith, affected by your faith, but without transferring it in any official way to other people.
That's why I fight against poverty.
That's why I fight to clean up the environment and protect this earth.
That's why I fight for equality and justice.
All of those things come out of that fundamental teaching and belief of faith.
But I know this, that President Kennedy in his inaugural address told all of us that here on Earth, God's work must truly be our own.
And that's what we have to -- I think that's the test of public service.
Mr. President?
I think it's important to promote a culture of life.
I think a hospitable society is a society where every being counts and every person matters.
I believe the ideal world is one in which every child is protected in law and welcomed to life.
I understand there's great differences on this issue of abortion, but I believe reasonable people can come together and put good law in place that will help reduce the number of abortions.
Take, for example, the ban on partial birth abortion.
It's a brutal practice.
People from both political parties came together in the halls of Congress and voted overwhelmingly to ban that practice.
It made a lot of sense.
My opponent, in that he's out of the mainstream, voted against that law.
What I'm saying is, is that as we promote life and promote a culture of life, surely there are ways we can work together to reduce the number of abortions: continue to promote adoption laws -- it's a great alternative to abortion -- continue to fund and promote maternity group homes; I will continue to promote abstinence programs.
The last debate, my opponent said his wife was involved with those programs.
That's great.
I appreciate that very much.
All of us ought to be involved with programs that provide a viable alternative to abortion.
Mr. President, let's have a new question.
It goes to you.
And let's get back to economic issues.
Health insurance costs have risen over 36 percent over the last four years according to The Washington Post.
We're paying more.
We're getting less.
I would like to ask you: Who bears responsibility for this?
Is it the government?
Is it the insurance companies?
Is it the lawyers?
Is it the doctors?
Is it the administration?
Gosh, I sure hope it's not the administration.
There's a -- no, look, there's a systemic problem.
Health-care costs are on the rise because the consumers are not involved in the decision-making process.
Most health-care costs are covered by third parties.
And therefore, the actual user of health care is not the purchaser of health care.
And there's no market forces involved with health care.
It's one of the reasons I'm a strong believer in what they call health savings accounts.
These are accounts that allow somebody to buy a low-premium, high-deductible catastrophic plan and couple it with tax-free savings.
Businesses can contribute, employees can contribute on a contractual basis.
But this is a way to make sure people are actually involved with the decision-making process on health care.
Secondly, I do believe the lawsuits -- I don't believe, I know -- that the lawsuits are causing health-care costs to rise in America.
That's why I'm such a strong believer in medical liability reform.
In the last debate, my opponent said those lawsuits only caused the cost to go up by 1 percent.
Well, he didn't include the defensive practice of medicine that costs the federal government some $28 billion a year and costs our society between $60 billion and $100 billion a year.
Thirdly, one of the reasons why there's still high cost in medicine is because this is -- they don't use any information technology.
It's like if you looked at the -- it's the equivalent of the buggy and horse days, compared to other industries here in America.
And so, we've got to introduce high technology into health care.
We're beginning to do it.
We're changing the language.
We want there to be electronic medical records to cut down on error, as well as reduce cost.
People tell me that when the health-care field is fully integrated with information technology, it'll wring some 20 percent of the cost out of the system.
And finally, moving generic drugs to the market quicker.
And so, those are four ways to help control the costs in health care.
Senator Kerry?
The reason health-care costs are getting higher, one of the principal reasons is that this administration has stood in the way of common-sense efforts that would have reduced the costs.
Let me give you a prime example.
In the Senate we passed the right of Americans to import drugs from Canada.
But the president and his friends took it out in the House, and now you don't have that right.
The president blocked you from the right to have less expensive drugs from Canada.
We also wanted Medicare to be able to negotiate bulk purchasing.
The VA does that.
The VA provides lower-cost drugs to our veterans.
We could have done that in Medicare.
Medicare is paid for by the American taxpayer.
Medicare belongs to you.
Medicare is for seniors, who many of them are on fixed income, to lift them out of poverty.
But rather than help you, the taxpayer, have lower cost, rather than help seniors have less expensive drugs, the president made it illegal -- illegal -- for Medicare to actually go out and bargain for lower prices.
Result: $139 billion windfall profit to the drug companies coming out of your pockets.
That's a large part of your 17 percent increase in Medicare premiums.
When I'm president, I'm sending that back to Congress and we're going to get a real prescription drug benefit.
Now, we also have people sicker because they don't have health insurance.
So whether it's diabetes or cancer, they come to hospitals later and it costs America more.
We got to have health care for all Americans.
Go ahead, Mr. President.
I think it's important, since he talked about the Medicare plan, has he been in the United States Senate for 20 years?
He has no record on reforming of health care.
No record at all.
He introduced some 300 bills and he's passed five.
No record of leadership.
I came to Washington to solve problems.
I was deeply concerned about seniors having to choose between prescription drugs and food.
And so I led.
And in 2006, our seniors will get a prescription drug coverage in Medicare.
Senator Kerry?
Thirty seconds.
Once again, the president is misleading America.
I've actually passed 56 individual bills that I've personally written and, in addition to that, and not always under my name, there is amendments on certain bills.
But more importantly, with respect to the question of no record, I helped write -- I did write, I was one of the original authors of the early childhood health care and the expansion of health care that we did in the middle of the 1990s.
And I'm very proud of that.
So the president's wrong.
Let me direct the next question to you, Senator Kerry, and again, let's stay on health care.
You have, as you have proposed and as the president has commented on tonight, proposed a massive plan to extend health-care coverage to children.
You're also talking about the government picking up a big part of the catastrophic bills that people get at the hospital.
And you have said that you can pay for this by rolling back the president's tax cut on the upper 2 percent.
You heard the president say earlier tonight that it's going to cost a whole lot more money than that.
I'd just ask you, where are you going to get the money?
Well, two leading national news networks have both said the president's characterization of my health-care plan is incorrect.
One called it fiction.
The other called it untrue.
The fact is that my health-care plan, America, is very simple.
It gives you the choice.
I don't force you to do anything.
It's not a government plan.
The government doesn't require you to do anything.
You choose your doctor.
You choose your plan.
If you don't want to take the offer of the plan that I want to put forward, you don't have do.
You can keep what you have today, keep a high deductible, keep high premiums, keep a high co-pay, keep low benefits.
But I got a better plan.
And I don't think a lot of people are going to want to keep what they have today.
Here's what I do: We take over Medicaid children from the states so that every child in America is covered.
And in exchange, if the states want to -- they're not forced to, they can choose to -- they cover individuals up to 300 percent of poverty.
It's their choice.
I think they'll choose it, because it's a net plus of $5 billion to them.
We allow you -- if you choose to, you don't have to -- but we give you broader competition to allow you to buy into the same health care plan that senators and congressmen give themselves.
If it's good enough for us, it's good enough for every American.
I believe that your health care is just as important as any politician in Washington, D. C.  You want to buy into it, you can.
We give you broader competition.
That helps lower prices.
In addition to that, we're going to allow people 55 to 64 to buy into Medicare early.
And most importantly, we give small business a 50 percent tax credit so that after we lower the costs of health care, they also get, whether they're self-employed or a small business, a lower cost to be able to cover their employees.
Now, what happens is when you begin to get people covered like that -- for instance in diabetes, if you diagnose diabetes early, you could save $50 billion in the health care system of America by avoiding surgery and dialysis.
It works.
And I'm going to offer it to America.
Mr. President?
In all due respect, I'm not so sure it's credible to quote leading news organizations about -- oh, never mind.
Anyway, let me quote the Lewin report.
The Lewin report is a group of folks who are not politically affiliated.
They analyzed the senator's plan.
It cost $1.2 trillion.
The Lewin report accurately noted that there are going to be 20 million people, over 20 million people added to government-controlled health care.
