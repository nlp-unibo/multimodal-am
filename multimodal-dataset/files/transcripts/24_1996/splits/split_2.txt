We also raised the amount of each Pell Grant.
In our economic plan, the $500 child credit can be used for young people, rolled over and over and over, you, of course not this age, but if you have a child two years old, 7 percent interest would be worth about $18,000 by the time that child was ready for college.
I can only tell you that I don't think Senator Dole is too old to be president.
It's the age of his ideas that I question.
You're almost not old enough to remember this.
But we tried this before, promising people an election year tax cut that's not paid for.
You tried it last time you ran.
Tell him you can have everything you got.
And so let me just say this.
Did you hear him say that Congress just voted to increase student loans and scholarships?
They did after he left.
The last budget he led cut Pell Grants, cut student loans.
I vetoed it when they shut the government down.
My plan would give students a dollar-for-dollar reduction for the cost of a typical community college tuition.
A $10,000 deduction a year for the cost of college tuition.
We let families save in an IRA, withdraw tax free to pay for the cost of education and it's all paid for.
My whole administration is about your future.
It's about what the 21st century is going to be like for you.
I hope you will look at the ideas in it.
Thank you.
When you don't have any ideas, I guess you say the other person's ideas are old.
As I said earlier, they don't have any ideas.
Their ideas is to raise taxes and spend more money.
That's the liberal philosophy.
That's what you like, you've got a perfect candidate.
President Clinton came to California in 1992.
He said the centerpiece in my first four years is going to be a middle class tax cut.
Now all you got that tax cut, congratulations.
Because you got a big tax increase.
You got a 265 billion dollar tax increase.
And he stands here and says politicians who make promises like that ought to be ignored.
Well he made the promise.
I keep my word, and you will have a tax cut.
It will help you in whatever you're going to do in the next few years.
Thank you.
Next question is for President Clinton and it's from -- yes, ma'am.
Yes.
Hello.
My name is Tressia Sanders.
And my question is, do you feel that America has grown enough and has educated itself enough to totally cut out Affirmative Action?
No, ma'am, I don't.
I am against quotas.
I'm against giving anybody any kind of preference for something they're not qualified for.
But because I still believe that there is some discrimination and that not everybody has an opportunity to prove they're qualified, I favor the right kind of Affirmative Action.
I've done more to eliminate Affirmative Action programs I didn't think were fair and tighten others up than my predecessors have, since affirmative action's been around.
But I have also worked hard to give people a chance to prove that they are qualified.
Let me just give you some examples.
We've doubled the number of loans from the small business administration, tripled the number of loans to women business people, no one unqualified, everybody had to meet the standards.
We've opened 260,000 new jobs in the military to women since I've been president.
But the joint chiefs say we're stronger and more confident and solid than ever.
Let me give you another example of what I mean.
To me, Affirmative Action is making that extra effort.
It's sort of like what Senator Dole did when he sponsored the Americans with Disabilities Act and said to certain stores, okay, you have to make it accessible to people in wheelchairs.
We weren't guaranteeing anything, anybody anything except the chance to prove they were qualified, the chance to prove that they could do it.
And that's why I must say I agree with General Colin Powell that we're not there yet.
We ought to keep making those extra effort Affirmative Action programs, the law and the policy of the land.
Senator Dole.
Well, we may not be there yet but we're not going to get there by giving preferences and quotas.
I supported that route for some time and again I think it gets back to experience.
A little experience, a little age, a little intelligence.
And I noted that nobody was really benefitting except a very small group at the top.
The average person wasn't benefitting.
People who had the money were benefiting.
People who got all the jobs were benefiting.
It seems to me that we ought to support the California civil rights initiative.
It ought to be not based on gender or ethnicity or color.
Or disability.
I'm disabled.
I shouldn't have a preference.
I would like to have one in this race, come to think of it, but I don't get one.
Maybe we can work that out.
I get a 10-point spot.
This is America.
No discrimination.
Discrimination ought to be punished but there ought to be equal opportunity.
We ought to reach out, make certain everybody has a chance to participate.
Equal opportunity.
But we cannot guarantee equal results in America.
That's not how America became the greatest country on the face of the earth.
I have never supported quotas.
I've always been against them.
I don't favor equal results, but I do favor making sure everybody has a chance to prove they're competent.
The reason I have opposed that initiative is because I'm afraid it will end those extra effort programs.
Again I say, think of the Americans with Disabilities Act.
Make an effort to put a ramp up there so someone in a wheelchair can get up.
You don't guarantee they get the job.
You guarantee they have a chance to prove they're competent.
And as I said, this is not a partisan thing with me.
General Colin Powell said the same thing, he fears the initiative would take away the extra effort programs.
No preferences to unqualified people, no quotas, but don't give up on making an extra effort until you're sure everybody has a chance to prove they're qualified.
All right.
The next question is for Senator Dole and it comes from this section right here.
The back row there in the blue shirt Yes sir..
My name's Tim David.
I'm a mechanical engineer.
Senator Dole, how do you reduce taxes and balance the budget?
Well I'm glad you asked.
What's your first name?
Tim.
I first want to say the President didn't quite give you all of the stuff on the quotas, because the Justice Department had what we called the Piscataway case up in New Jersey.
It's pretty clear that was a quota case, and just because one teacher was white and one black and they had the same qualifications, you know they decided who would stay there.
It shouldn't be that way.
Now, the President can say well he wants to mend it, not end it.
There are 168 federal programs that allow quotas.
He ended one.
Now, this economic package, Tim, I'm glad you asked, because you look like the type that might be able to benefit from a 15 percent across- the-board tax cut and $500-per-child tax credit, or -- you know, estate tax relief which you're not interested in right now, but capital gains rate reduction.
If you're taking care of an elderly parent, you get a $1,000 deduction.
We think that's very important because a lot of people take care of their parents.
How do we pay for it?
You can have a constitutional amendment to balance the budget, which the President opposed and defeated.
He twisted arms and got six Democrats to vote with him and lost by one vote.
We're going to balance the budget, by the year 2002.
The President wants to spend 20 percent more in the next six years, and I want to spend 14 percent more and give that 6 percent back to the people.
Remember, it's your money; it's not his money.
And it's not my money.
It's your money.
And you shouldn't have to apologize for wanting to keep all you can of it.
But he ought to apologize for wanting to take more and more.
He wants to give you sort of a government tax cut, which really doesn't mean anything.
You know, one of the responsibilities of growing older, it seems to me, is being able to tell people something they may not want to hear just because it's true.
When they had a 250 billion dollar tax scheme, that is half the size of this one.
This one is 550.
They passed the budget.
They have 270 billion dollars in Medicare cuts the first education cuts in history, cut environmental enforcement by 25 percent, took away the guarantee of quality standards in nursing homes, took away the guarantee of health care for folks with disabilities.
Don't take my word for this.
The Economist magazine polled lots of economists, seven Nobel prize winners who said if this tax scheme passes, it will require huge cuts, 40 percent, in the environment and law enforcement and education.
It will require bigger cuts in Medicare than I vetoed last time.
My targeted tax cut is for child-rearing, buying a first-time home, paying for health care costs.
And it's paid for, and I'll tell you how I'll pay for it.
He won't tell you because he can't.
Your targeted tax cut, Mr. President, never hits anybody.
That's the problem with it.
Nobody ever gets it.
But I must say I'm a little offended by this word "scheme."
You talked about it last time, you talked about a risky scheme and Vice President Gore repeated it about ten times in St. Petersburg.
If I have anything in politics, it's my word.
My colleagues, Democrats and Republicans, will tell you that Bob Dole kept his word.
I'm going to keep my word to you.
I'm going to keep my word to the American people.
We're going to tax -- cut taxes and balance the budget.
We're not going to touch Medicare.
It's going to grow 39 percent, and Social Security is going to grow 34 percent.
The President doesn't have any ideas so he's out trashing ours.
This isn't going to blow a hole in the deficit.
He promised you a tax cut in 1992, and if you got one, you ought to vote for him.
The next question is for the President.
Yes sir right there.
My name is Duane Burns.
I'm a martial arts instructor and a father.
Mr. President, could you outline any plans you have to expand the Family Leave Act?
Thank you, well, first let me say that I signed the Family Leave Act.
It was my very first bill, and I'm very proud of it because it symbolizes what I think we ought to be doing.
I don't take credit for all the good things that have happened in America, but I take credit for what I've tried to do to work with others to make good things happen.
Most important good things that happen in America happen in families.
Just about every family I know, the main concern is how am I going to succeed at work and still do right by my children.
Family medical leave has let 12 million families take a little time off for the birth of a child or a family illness without losing their job.
I'd like to see it expanded in two ways.
I'd like to say you can also take a little time off without losing your job to go to a regular parent-teacher conference or to go to a regular doctor's appointment with a family member.
I'd also like to see the overtime laws change so that we could have some more flex time so that at the discretion of the worker, the worker, if you earn overtime, you could decide when you want that time to be taken, in cash or in time with your family if you've got a family problem.
I never go anywhere, it seems like, where I don't meet somebody who has benefited from a Family Leave Law.
In Longview, Texas the other day, I met a woman who was almost in tears because she had been able to keep her job while spending time with her husband who had cancer.
One of the people who's here with me today met a woman in the airport saying her son, Jess was able to be present at the birth of her child because of the Family Leave Law.
So yes, I think it should be expanded.
We have to help people succeed at home and at work.
Well, 88 percent of the people -- the President claims 11 million are already covered and only 5 percent -- keep in mind only 5 percent of the employers are affected by the Family Leave Act.
We had a better idea.
We didn't win.
We had a better idea.
Now we have a majority and we get a president.
That was a tax credit for the employer.
Instead of the federal government, we had that tax credit, pick up some of the costs, because if you have to hire a replacement worker, that's a cost.
This is the way it ought to work, give more power back to the states and back to the people back to the taxpayers, not always the long arm of the federal government.
But keep in mind this bill covers 5 percent of the employers, and 95 percent of the employers and all those employees they employ are not covered in this act.
And according to Investors Daily, which I read just a couple of days ago, 88 percent of the people he claims credit for are already covered in collective bargaining agreements or other agreements.
We had family leave in our office, I'm certain.
I see my friend Senator Mitchell.
He had family leave.
I work every day with people.
I spend a lot of time in hospitals.
I know what it's like to be in a hospital.
Sure we want family leave.
But there's a better way to do it.
I only have 30 seconds.
I can't fix the statistics.
It covers the majority of the work force.
Employers of under 50 are exempted.
The bill originally covered employers of 25 and more, but because of opposition, we went up to 50.
Senator Dole led the opposition to it.
He filibustered it.
He said it was a mistake.
He said it would hurt the economy.
We've had record numbers of new small businesses and 10 and a half million jobs.
It didn't hurt the economy.
He still believes it's a mistake.
I believe it's right.
You can decide which of us you think are right.
It's up to you.
Next question for Senator Dole.
Yes, ma'am.
Hi.
My name is Bridget Giannotti, and I'm a wife and mother of two sons, from Carlsbad.
And my question to you, Senator Dole, is as the wife of a San Diego business owner, I see one of our biggest problems in the U.S. is it does not manufacture enough of our own products.
How would you help this problem out?
Well, right.
We've lost 357,000 manufacturing jobs.
The Bureau of Labor Statistics today said they made a mistake.
It's probably going to take a much, much higher figure.
So we talk about all these new jobs.
We'd better wait and see what the results are.
We're going to do that with a more aggressive trade policy.
We're going to do that with an economic package.
We're going to do that with regulatory reform.
You know, regulations cost the average family right here, Democrat or Republican, about $7,000 a year.
7,000.
That's like a tax.
It's put a lot of people out of business.
I met a lady in Colorado Springs about seven weeks ago now.
She had a small business with 63 employees.
She finally gave it up.
Why?
Because of paperwork and regulation.
Congress passed a paperwork reduction act.
The President exempts the IRS which creates three-fourths of the paperwork.
We're going to have regulatory -- we're gonna have litigation reform.
You know, I fell off a platform out in California, Chico, a while back.
Before I hit the ground, my cell phone rang and this trial lawyer said, I think we've got a case here.
(Laughter).
We've got to stop some of these frivolous lawsuits.
They're putting people out of business, men and women.
Get the economy going, cut the capital gains rate, create more jobs and opportunities for everybody in America.
That's what we will do.
And my word is good.
I keep my promises.
I don't break my promises after the election, and I don't make new promises in an election year.
We're going to get it done.
We're going to grow some of these jobs in America, because we need to get it -- they're going the wrong way.
Let's look at the facts.
We lost a lot of manufacturing jobs in the 12 years before I became President.
We've gained manufacturing jobs since I've been President.
We've negotiated over 200 separate trade agreements.
Let's just take California.
In California, we made 37 billion dollars' worth of telecommunications equipment eligible for export for the first time.
We're selling everything from from -- from telephones to CDs to rice in Japan.
We're selling American automobiles in Japan now.
I visited a Chrysler dealership in Japan.
We're No.1 in automobile manufacturing production and sales around the world again, the first time since 1970s.
Why?
Because we've had tough aggressive trade policies, and because we've got interest rates down.
We have a good, stable economic policy.
Because we reduced the deficit four years in a row.
For the first time in the 20th century the President has done that in all four years and that's why I don't want to see us blow a big hole in the deficit with a tax program we can't pay for, so your interest rates will go up, and you'll have to pay back in higher interest rates what you allegedly will get in a tax cut, so I say keep working on expanding the markets.
More than half of these 10 and a half million new jobs are in higher wage areas and we'll have more manufacturing and sales around the world.
You may think the biggest employer in America is General Motors, but I've got news for you.
It's Manpower Services.
Hiring people temporarily who have lost their jobs and they get to work for 30 days or 60 days.
That's a good economy?
I don't think so.
They're setting new records this year.
We had the worst economy in a century.
We had the slowest growth, about 2.5 percent.
The president inherited growth of over 5 percent.
We don't have the S&amp;L crisis anymore.
Republicans have cut 53 billion dollars in spending, that's why the budget looked good.
It didn't look good the first two years when we had a Democratic president and Â Democratic Congress.
Next question is for President Clinton.
Yes, sir.
I'm Bob Goldfarb.
I'm a travel agent and can you please explain your policy on the Employment Nondiscrimination Act that would have prohibited discrimination, would have prohibited people from being fired from their jobs simply for being gay or lesbian.
I'm for it.
That's my policy.
I'm for it.
I believe that any law- abiding, tax-paying citizen who shows up in the morning and doesn't break the law and doesn't interfere with his or her neighbors ought to have the ability to work in our country and shouldn't be subject to unfair discrimination.
I'm for it.
Now, I have a little time left so let me just say that I get attacked so many times on these questions; it's hard to answer these things.
Senator Dole just said we had the worst economy in the century.
In February he said we had the best economy in Â 30 years, just February.
And I don't want to respond in kind to all these things.
I could.
I could answer a lot of these things tit for tat.
But I hope we can talk about what we're going to do in the future.
No attack ever created a job or educated a child, or helped a family make ends meet.
No insult ever cleaned up a toxic waste dump or helped an elderly person.
Now, for four years that's what I worked on.
If you give me four years more I will work on it some more and I will try to answer these charges, but I prefer to emphasize direct answers to the future and I gave you a direct answer.
Senator Dole.
Well, I'm opposed to discrimination in any form but I don't favor creating special rights for any group.
That would be my answer to this question.
And I'm, you know -- there would be special rights for different groups in America.
But I'm totally opposed to discrimination.
I don't have any policy against hiring anyone; whether it's lifestyle or whatever, we don't have any policy of that kind, never have had in my office or will we have in the future.
But as far as special rights, I'm opposed to same-sex marriages, which the President signed well after midnight one morning in the dark of night.
I opposed it.
But I will get back to the economic package because, again, I think this is very important.
If there's anything that's going to change America it's get the economy growing.
The President inherited a good economy, sure the S&amp;L crisis then were selling assets.
Got a Republican Congress cutting spending finally and he said
