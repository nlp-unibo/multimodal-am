it's the best four years ever.
That's not true.
We had a 1.2 million bankruptcy, set a new record.
Credit card debt has never been higher.
I just told you about this manufacturing job loss which is going to increase.
We need a good strong economic package, let the private sector creates the jobs and they can do it.
If you believe that the California economy was better in 1992 than it is today, you should vote for Bob Dole.
I have worked so hard out here to help turn this economy around.
Let me just give you one tiny example.
In San Diego where we had some defense cutbacks, we funded a project for the University of California San Diego to use airplane composite materials to build lighter, stronger bridges, a little project in a program that Senator Dole opposed.
And that composite now is going to be built around the bridges on the Santa Monica Freeway to help minimize the impact of earthquakes and create more jobs.
That's just one tiny example.
Maybe we will talk about some more before it's over.
Next question's for Senator Dole this section.
Yes, ma'am.
Yes.
Senator Dole, I am Bertha Strategos, and I work in health care and it's truly an honor to be here tonight to address both of you.
Thank you.
Being in health care -- we have talked about a little bit about health care tonight, but mainly Medi-Cal and Medicare have been mentioned, but the private sector is a problem.
Managed care is taking over, especially in California.
And because of that, the quality of care is going downhill.
There are many, many people who cannot get the tests that they need when they need them, and because of that, they are dying needlessly.
There are many, many more lawsuits being presented against the managed care industry because of this.
And I think it's a real problem that needs to be addressed.
What would you do if you were president?
Well, one thing I did was oppose the government takeover health care that President Clinton offered in 1993, which created 17 new taxes and 50 new bureaucracies and price controls, because we were afraid the very thing you mentioned would have happened.
Everybody would have been forced into managed care.
You couldn't have chosen your own doctor and that would have been the end.
And I think right now we got to go back.
I know they've appointed a commission to take a look at managed care.
Maybe that's part of the answer.
But it seems to me if we start to take choices away from people and if we drive them into one type care, eliminate fee-for-service altogether or eliminate the fact you can go to your own doctor, you have to go somewhere else, then I think we've taken a giant step backward in the United States of America.
We have the best health care delivery system in the world and we want to keep it that way.
That's why we opposed the government take over health care plan that President Clinton tried and tried and tried to get through Congress.
Didn't get it done.
And ended up we had more votes than he had, then they decided to pull the plug.
It was a big, big mistake.
Now whether or not he'll do that again I've heard some of the people say, well, that's the model we ought to use and if he's reelected maybe he will come back and try it again.
I hope not.
I hope not in both cases.
But it does seem to me that you've raised a very important point that needs to be addressed.
You're going to have to watch it.
Gonna have to take a look at all the managed care going on in California, or we're going to end up losing our best care that we have in the world.
I'm just curious.
How many of you are under managed care plans?
Raise your hand if you're in managed care plan.
How many of you like it?
Two.
Well, one of the things that I tried to do was to make sure that everybody in the country who was under a managed care plan should at least have three choices of plans, and would have the right to get out without penalty every year.
Now that's not a government takeover.
That's like the family of medical-leave law; it just tries to set the rules of the game.
I'm strongly in favor of a federal bill to repeal any gag rules on providers.
In other words, I believe that doctors should not be able to be kicked out of managed care plans just because they tell the patients what they need and what more expensive care options might be.
If we're saving money and managing resources better, that's a good thing.
If we're saving money and depriving people of care, that's a bad thing.
A good place to start is to say no managed care provider can gag a doctor and kick the doctor out of the managed care plan for the doctor, telling the patient, you need a more expensive test, you need a more expensive procedure, your health requires it.
Senator Dole.
Well, I don't have any quarrel with that.
I think that would help.
But I think what we want to avoid is falling back into this nationalized health care system that President Clinton wanted to give us in 1993.
If that isn't a liberal idea, I've never heard one.
17 new taxes, price controls, 50 new bureaucracies.
We'd have that trouble all over America.
We need to deal with managed care.
It not only happened in California.
It's happening in other states that we visit, too.
It's a national problem.
Not just a state problem.
The next question is for President Clinton in this section.
Yes, ma'am.
Yes.
I would sort of like -- Colleen O'Connor.
I teach history and political science in San Diego Mesa College right up the road here.
And I would like to tee off from the original question by another teacher and speak for those people that aren't here tonight.
63 percent of the American people are not participating that are eligible to vote, not even participating in the process.
Several parties can't even get in the debate; the Green Party, the Reform Party, the Natural Law Party, all of these people are basically opted out of what we're still participating in.
If we in fact are going to bring the country back together and be all faces around the table, the new American family, what do you see as something the president can do to begin that process to bring them back in?
First of all, I think it's important to make voting more accessible.
That's why I strongly supported the Motor Voter law.
There was a big story I think in U.S.A. Today of the millions of people who have now registered because of it.
Secondly, I think we need to look at making the elections more accessible.
You know several states now are letting people vote over three weeks.
A lot of people are busy and it's hard for them to just get there and vote.
Third thing I think we need is more forums like this, which is one of the reasons I have so strongly supported campaign finance reform.
Because if you want to cut the cost of campaigns, you have to open the airways, because what drives the cost of campaigns are the cost of advertising on television, radio, newspaper, mass mailing.
And if you open the airways to more things like this, you see it's not just you that are participating here.
For every one of you who stood up here and asked a question tonight, I promise you there's a 100,000 Americans who said I wish I could have asked that question.
So I think we have to change the nature of politics.
The last thing I think we should do is something I have been trying to do since I have been president, is every time I do something in a public way, I try to have a real American citizen there who is directly affected by it so that people can see the connection of what happens way across the country, in Washington with more police on the street, in San Diego, clean up the sewage here in San Diego, doubling the border guards here in Southern California, that there is a connection between what we do way back there and what we do here.
Those are my best ideas about it.
Well, I don't know of any perfect solution.
I have been in politics for some time, and I worry about the people who don't vote.
And I wonder if it's our fault, the candidates' fault.
People say, "I don't care.
One vote doesn't make a difference."
I can give you hundreds of -- you can probably give me 200 cases where one vote made a difference.
I know it made a lot of difference many times in the Congress.
Campaign finance might help.
It might help the contributions from coming in from Indonesia or other foreign countries, rich people in those countries, and then being sent back after the L.A. Times discovers it, $250,000.
But maybe there ought to be more debates.
I would be willing to have another debate this year.
We can invite all the candidates.
And talk about the economy.
If we don't get the economy to grow, if we don't cut taxes, and give people child credits, and cut the capital gains rate, and get this economy growing, we're going to limp into the next century.
If we grow the economy it's going to help Social Security.
It's going to help jobs.
It's going to help everything.
Let me make one other suggestion, because you're a teacher, you can have an impact on that.
One of the things I think that really frustrates people is that so often political campaigns seem to be more about the politicians that are running than the people.
And there is a connection.
And I think what we have to do is convince people there is a big difference, if you vote one way you will have a Department of Education in the 21st century, if you vote the other way, you won't.
If you vote one way you will have an expansion of family leave.
If you vote the other way, you will be lucky to save it.
But these are important questions.
And people have to decide.
I think that the American people also need to be a little more responsible and think about whether there's a connection with their lives and what we do in Washington.
For Senator Dole, in this section, on the back row.
Yes, ma'am.
I'm Iris Siefert and I'm unemployed.
Iris.
Iris.
Senator Dole, we talked about Social Security for us baby boomers.
But shouldn't we be saving and investing for our own retirement as well?
Are you planning any incentives to encourage us to take care of ourselves rather than to rely on the government and on Social Security when we retire?
Well, we have in our economic pack, -- individual retirement accounts where we think it will encourage savings.
You can also use those accounts for health care or education or a first home.
We're doing that precisely, and I think one thing sooner or later we're going to have to consider is take a look at the Social Security system.
Because we've got a lot of people advocating we don't want to put our money into Social Security.
You have to be very careful of that because you have to protect the people who are already in the pipeline.
It's something you might consider.
I'm not suggesting it will be done, but at least we ought to look at it.
It's been looked, When I was chairman of the finance committee which handled Social Security we looked at all these options, and one thing we've got to make certain, when I used to go home my mother would tell me all I've got is my Social Security, don't touch it.
And we didn't touch it.
We preserved it.
And I'm an optimist.
Your your Social Security is going to be there when you retire.
We will fix it.
It will probably happen in the year 2012 or 2015.
In 1983 we thought we had a 75 -year fix.
It didn't work.
Much, much less, but at least we fixed it for some time and 37 to 40 million people get their checks on time.
So we need to preserve the system.
And we need to make it stronger.
But we also need to look at some options, whether or not we -- depending on what the options are.
In fact, they have got a commission right now in Congress, a bipartisan commission, looking at all the different options they will present to the next Congress.
so I think we will wait, see what they present, take a look at it.
Iris, this is one where we have some agreement, I think.
Only about half the people in this country have pension plans.
And Social Security is not enough for a lot of people to live on, or at least is not enough for them to maintain anything like their previous lifestyle.
So we've got to figure out how are we going to have more people with pension plans, and pension coverage has been declining as more and more people work for small businesses and fewer people work for big businesses.
So what, what is in my plan and I think it's almost identical in Senator Dole's plans is we make more people eligible to save in an IRA and let couples, married couples save more and then they could withdraw from it tax-free if they needed to, for medical emergencies or buy a home or education, but they could also save to supplement retirement.
In addition to that, we just passed a sweeping small business reform that makes it easier for small business people to take out 401 K plans for themselves and employees and much easier for employees to carry it from job to job.
My best friend from grade school is a computer software salesman and he told me last time he changed employers it took him nine months to figure out how to transfer his 401K plan.
Now none of that will happen anymore.
I hope over the next ten years you will see a big increase over the percentage of people that have pension plans, plus a secure Social Security system.
Did you say you're unemployed?
Yes.
See, the first thing we have to do is get you a job.
And that's the economic package again.
Create jobs and opportunities.
Reduce the capital gains rate.
Reduce regulatory reform.
Stop some of this senseless litigation and let people work in America.
And I think that's that's the thrust we will make.
Obviously if Social Security is a very important program, it should -- it will be preserved.
Democrats or Republicans, it will be preserved.
We want to make certain we protect those in the pipeline just as we did back in 1983 and we did it on a bipartisan basis.
We took it out of politics.
people get so tired of politics.
We ought to do the same with Medicare.
Maybe we can make a deal here tonight.
All right.
The question's is for President Clinton.
Does anybody have a foreign affairs question in this section?
Yes, sir.
Good evening.
I'm Michael Smith.
I'm an electronics technician in the Navy.
My question was how you plan to deal with the trade deficit with Japan.
Let me tell you what we have done.
We have concluded with Japan 21 -- about to be 22 -- trade agreements now.
And since we did that, in the areas where we concluded, trade agreements or exports to Japan have gone up by 85 percent in the last four years and our trade deficit with Japan has gone down.
Until about five months ago the Japanese economy was in a deep recession.
It's coming back now, so they can buy even more American products, and I think it will go down more.
But I'm very -- that's one of the real success stories here of the work we've done.
We're selling Japanese rice from California for the first time.
I visited a Chrysler dealership in Tokyo.
I visited a Jeep plant, oldest plant in America, a plant in Toledo, Ohio, where they're going to export 41,000 right hand drive Jeeps this year, and they've got 700 new jobs because of it.
There's no easy way to do this when you're dealing with an economy that's traditionally been more closed than one that's traditionally been more open.
You have to gut it out, issue by issue by issue.
We agreed in principle on an insurance agreement, and we're working on three or four other areas now, but the way you have to do it is make sure you're competitive.
We're the most competitive country in the world now, and then just fight to open those markets and go try to make the sale, and that's what our trade ambassador our commerce secretary and all the other people in our administration are trying to do.
Well, the bottom line is we have to stop exporting jobs here.
There are 357, 000 good jobs -- manufacturing jobs, which are lost.
And I assume some of those are because of our trading partners.
We didn't have access to their markets.
We ought to insist on access.
If we don't have access to their markets the same way they've access our markets, we ought to say, "Wait, that's enough.
Time out.
When you give us access, we'll give you access."
It's very hard to get into the Japan market, as everybody knows.
They want to get into our market.
They sell a lot of automobiles here, create a lot of jobs -- those who sell exports.
And that's very important to the economy, but I think we want to make certain.
I supported the President's trade policy.
But we got to be more aggressive.
Once you have a policy, then you have to go out and be aggressive and enforce that policy.
There are American jobs that are being lost.
This is what Ross Perot complains about.
And I'd say to the Reform party, take a look at the Republican party.
We're the reform party, and we're going to make things better, and one of the things we're going to do is stop exporting jobs.
Let me say again, we've had over 200 separate trade agreements in the last four years.
By far, the largest number in American history -- not just the big ones you read about, but a lot of smaller ones.
And now what we have to do is to focus on those things we're real good at and make sure we're getting a fair deal.
We just had a pretty serious dispute with China because they were copying our CDs, and costing thousands of jobs in places like California.
So we have -- as we said, if you want to keep doing business and selling your products over here, you're going to have to quit pirating our CDs, and they agreed to do things and verify that they had done it, which will make the problem much better.
There is not a simple answer.
You have to work on this day in and day out, every month ,every year, every issue, to make sure that we have not only free trade but fair trade.
I'm proud that we're better off on that than we were four years ago.
The next question is for Senator Dole -- in this section.
Yes, sir?
Rod Kite, minister.
Hi, Rod.
This great nation has been established by the founding fathers who possessed a very strong Christian belief in godly principles.
If elected president of the United States, what could you do to return this nation to these basic principles?
And also, do you feel that the president -- the office of president has the responsibility to set the role example to inspire our young people?
Well no doubt about it, our founding fathers had a great deal of wisdom.
In addition to what you mentioned, they also were concerned about this all-powerful central government in Washington, D.C., that'd in effect confiscate your property, so -- I carry it in my pocket -- I can't pull it out or I'd violate the rules -- a copy of the Tenth Amendment which says we ought to return power to the states and the people, the people here.
You ought to make more decisions.
Honor, duty, and country, that's what America is all about.
Certainly the President of the United States, the highest office in the world, the most important office in the world, has a responsibility to young people, as we talked about earlier.
To everyone.
By example.
And when it comes to public ethics, he has a responsibility.
And you have 30-some in your administration, either left or being investigated or in jail or whatever, then you've got an ethical problem.
This is public ethics; I'm not talking about private ethics.
Talking about public ethics.
When you have 900 files gathered up by some guy who is a bouncer in a bar and hired a security officer to collect files, in Watergate -- I know a person who went to jail for looking at one file, one FBI file.
There are 900 sequestered in the White House.
900.
People like you.
Why should they be rifling through your
