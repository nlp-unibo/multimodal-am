is, I want people to have tax cuts.
I want every family to have a $5,000 refundable tax credit so they can go out and purchase their own health care.
I want to double the dividend from $3,500 to $7,000 for every dependent child in America.
I know that the worst thing we could possibly do is to raise taxes on anybody, and a lot of people might be interested in Senator Obama's definition of "rich."
Senator Obama, you have a question for Senator McCain on that?
Well, let me just make a couple of points.
All right.
My definition -- here's what I can tell the American people: 95 percent of you will get a tax cut.
And if you make less than $250,000, less than a quarter-million dollars a year, then you will not see one dime's worth of tax increase.
Now, John mentioned the fact that business taxes on paper are high in this country, and he's absolutely right.
Here's the problem: There are so many loopholes that have been written into the tax code, oftentimes with support of Senator McCain, that we actually see our businesses pay effectively one of the lowest tax rates in the world.
And what that means, then, is that there are people out there who are working every day, who are not getting a tax cut, and you want to give them more.
It's not like you want to close the loopholes.
You just want to add an additional tax cut over the loopholes.
And that's a problem.
Just one last point I want to make, since Senator McCain talked about providing a $5,000 health credit.
Now, what he doesn't tell you is that he intends to, for the first time in history, tax health benefits.
So you may end up getting a $5,000 tax credit.
Here's the only problem: Your employer now has to pay taxes on the health care that you're getting from your employer.
And if you end up losing your health care from your employer, you've got to go out on the open market and try to buy it.
It is not a good deal for the American people.
But it's an example of this notion that the market can always solve everything and that the less regulation we have, the better off we're going to be.
Well, you know, let me just...
We've got to go to another lead question.
I know we have to, but this is a classic example of walking the walk and talking the talk.
We had an energy bill before the United States Senate.
It was festooned with Christmas tree ornaments.
It had all kinds of breaks for the oil companies, I mean, billions of dollars worth.
I voted against it; Senator Obama voted for it.
John, you want to give oil companies another $4 billion.
You've got to look at our record.
You've got to look at our records.
That's the important thing.
Who fought against wasteful and earmark spending?
Who has been the person who has tried to keep spending under control?
Who's the person who has believed that the best thing for America is -- is to have a tax system that is fundamentally fair?
And I've fought to simplify it, and I have proposals to simplify it.
Let's give every American a choice: two tax brackets, generous dividends, and, two -- and let Americans choose whether they want the -- the existing tax code or they want a new tax code.
And so, again, look at the record, particularly the energy bill.
But, again, Senator Obama has shifted on a number of occasions.
He has voted in the United States Senate to increase taxes on people who make as low as $42,000 a year.
That's not true, John.
That's not true.
And that's just a fact.
Again, you can look it up.
Look, it's just not true.
And if we want to talk about oil company profits, under your tax plan, John -- this is undeniable -- oil companies would get an additional $4 billion in tax breaks.
Now, look, we all would love to lower taxes on everybody.
But here's the problem: If we are giving them to oil companies, then that means that there are those who are not going to be getting them.
And...
With all due respect, you already gave them to the oil companies.
No, but, John, the fact of the matter is, is that I was opposed to those tax breaks, tried to strip them out.
We've got an energy bill on the Senate floor right now that contains some good stuff, some stuff you want, including drilling off-shore, but you're opposed to it because it would strip away those tax breaks that have gone to oil companies.
All right.
All right, speaking of things that both of you want, another lead question, and it has to do with the rescue -- the financial rescue thing that we started -- started asking about.
And what -- and the first answer is to you, Senator Obama.
As president, as a result of whatever financial rescue plan comes about and the billion, $700 billion, whatever it is it's going to cost, what are you going to have to give up, in terms of the priorities that you would bring as president of the United States, as a result of having to pay for the financial rescue plan?
Well, there are a range of things that are probably going to have to be delayed.
We don't yet know what our tax revenues are going to be.
The economy is slowing down, so it's hard to anticipate right now what the budget is going to look like next year.
But there's no doubt that we're not going to be able to do everything that I think needs to be done.
There are some things that I think have to be done.
We have to have energy independence, so I've put forward a plan to make sure that, in 10 years' time, we have freed ourselves from dependence on Middle Eastern oil by increasing production at home, but most importantly by starting to invest in alternative energy, solar, wind, biodiesel, making sure that we're developing the fuel-efficient cars of the future right here in the United States, in Ohio and Michigan, instead of Japan and South Korea.
We have to fix our health care system, which is putting an enormous burden on families.
Just -- a report just came out that the average deductible went up 30 percent on American families.
They are getting crushed, and many of them are going bankrupt as a consequence of health care.
I'm meeting folks all over the country.
We have to do that now, because it will actually make our businesses and our families better off.
The third thing we have to do is we've got to make sure that we're competing in education.
We've got to invest in science and technology.
China had a space launch and a space walk.
We've got to make sure that our children are keeping pace in math and in science.
And one of the things I think we have to do is make sure that college is affordable for every young person in America.
And I also think that we're going to have to rebuild our infrastructure, which is falling behind, our roads, our bridges, but also broadband lines that reach into rural communities.
Also, making sure that we have a new electricity grid to get the alternative energy to population centers that are using them.
So there are some -- some things that we've got to do structurally to make sure that we can compete in this global economy.
We can't shortchange those things.
We've got to eliminate programs that don't work, and we've got to make sure that the programs that we do have are more efficient and cost less.
Are you -- what priorities would you adjust, as president, Senator McCain, because of the -- because of the financial bailout cost?
Look, we, no matter what, we've got to cut spending.
We have -- as I said, we've let government get completely out of control.
Senator Obama has the most liberal voting record in the United States Senate.
It's hard to reach across the aisle from that far to the left.
The point -- the point is -- the point is, we need to examine every agency of government.
First of all, by the way, I'd eliminate ethanol subsidies.
I oppose ethanol subsidies.
I think that we have to return -- particularly in defense spending, which is the largest part of our appropriations -- we have to do away with cost-plus contracts.
We now have defense systems that the costs are completely out of control.
We tried to build a little ship called the Littoral Combat Ship that was supposed to cost $140 million, ended up costing $400 million, and we still haven't done it.
So we need to have fixed-cost contracts.
We need very badly to understand that defense spending is very important and vital, particularly in the new challenges we face in the world, but we have to get a lot of the cost overruns under control.
I know how to do that.
I saved the taxpayers $6.8 billion by fighting a contract that was negotiated between Boeing and DOD that was completely wrong.
And we fixed it and we killed it and the people ended up in federal prison so I know how to do this because I've been involved these issues for many, many years.
But I think that we have to examine every agency of government and find out those that are doing their job and keep them and find out those that aren't and eliminate them and we'll have to scrub every agency of government.
But if I hear the two of you correctly neither one of you is suggesting any major changes in what you want to do as president as a result of the financial bailout?
Is that what you're saying?
No.
As I said before, Jim, there are going to be things that end up having to be ...
Like what?
... deferred and delayed.
Well, look, I want to make sure that we are investing in energy in order to free ourselves from the dependence on foreign oil.
That is a big project.
That is a multi-year project.
Not willing to give that up?
Not willing to give up the need to do it but there may be individual components that we can't do.
But John is right we have to make cuts.
We right now give $15 billion every year as subsidies to private insurers under the Medicare system.
Doesn't work any better through the private insurers.
They just skim off $15 billion.
That was a give away and part of the reason is because lobbyists are able to shape how Medicare works.
They did it on the Medicaid prescription drug bill and we have to change the culture.
Tom -- or John mentioned me being wildly liberal.
Mostly that's just me opposing George Bush's wrong headed policies since I've been in Congress but I think it is that it is also important to recognize I worked with Tom Coburn, the most conservative, one of the most conservative Republicans who John already mentioned to set up what we call a Google for government saying we'll list every dollar of federal spending to make sure that the taxpayer can take a look and see who, in fact, is promoting some of these spending projects that John's been railing about.
What I'm trying to get at this is this.
Excuse me if I may, senator.
Trying to get at that you all -- one of you is going to be the president of the United States come January.
At the -- in the middle of a huge financial crisis that is yet to be resolved.
And what I'm trying to get at is how this is going to affect you not in very specific -- small ways but in major ways and the approach to take as to the presidency.
How about a spending freeze on everything but defense, veteran affairs and entitlement programs.
Spending freeze?
I think we ought to seriously consider with the exceptions of caring for our veterans national defense and several other vital issues.
Would you go for that?
The problem with a spending freeze is you're using a hatchet where you need a scalpel.
There are some programs that are very important that are under funded.
I went to increase early childhood education and the notion that we should freeze that when there may be, for example, this Medicare subsidy, I think, doesn't make sense.
Let me tell you another place to look for some savings.
We are currently spending $10 billion a month in Iraq when they have a $79 billion surplus.
It seems to me that if we're going to be strong at home as well as strong abroad, that we have to look at bringing that war to a close.
Look, we are sending $700 billion a year overseas to countries that don't like us very much.
Some of that money ends up in the hands of terrorist organizations.
We have to have wind, tide, solar, natural gas, flex fuel cars and all that but we also have to have offshore drilling and we also have to have nuclear power.
Senator Obama opposes both storing and reprocessing of spent nuclear fuel.
You can't get there from here and the fact is that we can create 700,000 jobs by building constructing 45 new nuclear power plants by the year 2030.
Nuclear power is not only important as far as eliminating our dependence on foreign oil but it's also responsibility as far as climate change is concerned.
An issue I have been involved in for many, many years and I'm proud of the work of the work that I've done there along with Senator Clinton.
Before we go to another lead question.
Let me figure out a way to ask the same question in a slightly different way here.
Are you -- are you willing to acknowledge both of you that this financial crisis is going to affect the way you rule the country as president of the United States beyond the kinds of things that you have already -- I mean, is it a major move?
Is it going to have a major affect?
There's no doubt itâ€™s gonna affect our budgets.
There is no doubt about it.
Not only -- Even if we get all $700 billion back, let's assume the markets recover, we're holding assets long enough that eventually taxpayers get it back and that happened during the Great Depression when Roosevelt purchased a whole bunch of homes, over time, home values went back up and in fact government made a profit.
If we're lucky and we do it right, that could potentially happen but in the short term there's an outlay and we may not see that money for a while.
And because of the economy's slowing down, I think we can also expect less tax revenue so there's no doubt that as president I'm going to have to make some tough decision.
The only point I want to make is this, that in order to make those tough decisions we have to know what our values are and who we're fighting for and what our priorities are and if we are spending $300 billion on tax cuts for people who don't need them and weren't even asking for them, and we are leaving out health care which is crushing on people all across the country, then I think we have made a bad decision and I want to make sure we're not shortchanging our long term priorities.
Well, I want to make sure we're not handing the health care system over to the federal government which is basically what would ultimately happen with Senator Obama's health care plan.
I want the families to make decisions between themselves and their doctors.
Not the federal government.
Look.
We have to obviously cut spending.
I have fought to cut spending.
Senator Obama has $800 billion in new spending programs.
I would suggest he start by canceling some of those new spending program that he has.
We can't I think adjust spending around to take care of the very much needed programs, including taking care of our veterans but I also want to say again a healthy economy with low taxes would not raising anyone's taxes is probably the best recipe for eventually having our economy recover.
And spending restraint has got to be a vital part of that.
And the reason, one of the major reasons why we're in the difficulties we are in today is because spending got out of control.
We owe China $500 billion.
And spending, I know, can be brought under control because I have fought against excessive spending my entire career.
And I got plans to reduce and eliminate unnecessary and wasteful spending and if there's anybody here who thinks there aren't agencies of government where spending can be cut and their budgets slashed they have not spent a lot of time in Washington.
I just want to make this point, Jim.
John, it's been your president who you said you agreed with 90 percent of the time who presided over this increase in spending.
This orgy of spending and enormous deficits you voted for almost all of his budgets.
So to stand here and after eight years and say that you're going to lead on controlling spending and, you know, balancing our tax cuts so that they help middle class families when over the last eight years that hasn't happened I think just is, you know, kind of hard to swallow.
Quick response to Senator Obama.
It's well-known that I have not been elected Miss Congeniality in the United States Senate nor with the administration.
I have opposed the president on spending, on climate change, on torture of prisoner, on - on Guantanamo Bay.
On a -- on the way that the Iraq War was conducted.
I have a long record and the American people know me very well and that is independent and a maverick of the Senate and I'm happy to say that I've got a partner that's a good maverick along with me now.
All right.
Let's go another subject.
Lead question, two minutes to you, senator McCain.
Much has been said about the lessons of Vietnam.
What do you see as the lessons of Iraq?
I think the lessons of Iraq are very clear that you cannot have a failed strategy that will then cause you to nearly lose a conflict.
Our initial military success, we went in to Baghdad and everybody celebrated.
And then the war was very badly mishandled.
I went to Iraq in 2003 and came back and said, we've got to change this strategy.
This strategy requires additional troops, it requires a fundamental change in strategy and I fought for it.
And finally, we came up with a great general and a strategy that has succeeded.
This strategy has succeeded.
And we are winning in Iraq.
And we will come home with victory and with honor.
And that withdrawal is the result of every counterinsurgency that succeeds.
And I want to tell you that now that we will succeed and our troops will come home, and not in defeat, that we will see a stable ally in the region and a fledgling democracy.
The consequences of defeat would have been increased Iranian influence.
It would have been increase in sectarian violence.
It would have been a wider war, which the United States of America might have had to come back.
So there was a lot at stake there.
And thanks to this great general, David Petraeus, and the troops who serve under him, they have succeeded.
And we are winning in Iraq, and we will come home.
And we will come home as we have when we have won other wars and not in defeat.
Two minutes, how you see the lessons of Iraq, Senator Obama.
Well, this is an area where Senator McCain and I have a fundamental difference because I think the first question is whether we should have gone into the war in the first place.
Now six years ago, I stood up and opposed this war at a time when it was politically risky to do so because I said that not only did we not know how much it was going to cost, what our exit strategy might be, how it would affect our relationships around the world, and whether our intelligence was sound, but also because we hadn't finished the job in Afghanistan.
We hadn't caught bin Laden.
We hadn't put al Qaeda to rest, and as a consequence, I thought that it was going to be a distraction.
Now Senator McCain and President Bush had a very different judgment.
And I wish I had been wrong
