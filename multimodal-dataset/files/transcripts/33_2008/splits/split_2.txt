for the sake of the country and they had been right, but that's not the case.
We've spent over $600 billion so far, soon to be $1 trillion.
We have lost over 4,000 lives.
We have seen 30,000 wounded, and most importantly, from a strategic national security perspective, al Qaeda is resurgent, stronger now than at any time since 2001.
We took our eye off the ball.
And not to mention that we are still spending $10 billion a month, when they have a $79 billion surplus, at a time when we are in great distress here at home, and we just talked about the fact that our budget is way overstretched and we are borrowing money from overseas to try to finance just some of the basic functions of our government.
So I think the lesson to be drawn is that we should never hesitate to use military force, and I will not, as president, in order to keep the American people safe.
But we have to use our military wisely.
And we did not use our military wisely in Iraq.
Do you agree with that, the lesson of Iraq?
The next president of the United States is not going to have to address the issue as to whether we went into Iraq or not.
The next president of the United States is going to have to decide how we leave, when we leave, and what we leave behind.
That's the decision of the next president of the United States.
Senator Obama said the surge could not work, said it would increase sectarian violence, said it was doomed to failure.
Recently on a television program, he said it exceed our wildest expectations.
But yet, after conceding that, he still says that he would oppose the surge if he had to decide that again today.
Incredibly, incredibly Senator Obama didn't go to Iraq for 900 days and never asked for a meeting with General Petraeus.
Well, let's go at some of these things...
Senator Obama is the chairperson of a committee that oversights NATO that's in Afghanistan.
To this day, he has never had a hearing.
What about that point?
I mean, it's remarkable.
All right.
What about that point?
Which point?
He raised a whole bunch of them.
I know, OK, let's go to the latter point and we'll back up.
The point about your not having been...
Look, I'm very proud of my vice presidential selection, Joe Biden, who is the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, and as he explains, and as John well knows, the issues of Afghanistan, the issues of Iraq, critical issues like that, don't go through my subcommittee because they're done as a committee as a whole.
But that's Senate inside baseball.
But let's get back to the core issue here.
Senator McCain is absolutely right that the violence has been reduced as a consequence of the extraordinary sacrifice of our troops and our military families.
They have done a brilliant job, and General Petraeus has done a brilliant job.
But understand, that was a tactic designed to contain the damage of the previous four years of mismanagement of this war.
And so John likes -- John, you like to pretend like the war started in 2007.
You talk about the surge.
The war started in 2003, and at the time when the war started, you said it was going to be quick and easy.
You said we knew where the weapons of mass destruction were.
You were wrong.
You said that we were going to be greeted as liberators.
You were wrong.
You said that there was no history of violence between Shia and Sunni.
And you were wrong.
And so my question is...  (CROSSTALK)
Senator Obama...
... of judgment, of whether or not -- of whether or not -- if the question is who is best-equipped as the next president to make good decisions about how we use our military, how we make sure that we are prepared and ready for the next conflict, then I think we can take a look at our judgment.
I have got a lot on the plate here...
I'm afraid Senator Obama doesn't understand the difference between a tactic and a strategy.
But the important -- I'd like to tell you, two Fourths of July ago I was in Baghdad.
General Petraeus invited Senator Lindsey Graham and me to attend a ceremony where 688 brave young Americans, whose enlistment had expired, were reenlisting to stay and fight for Iraqi freedom and American freedom.
I was honored to be there.
I was honored to speak to those troops.
And you know, afterwards, we spent a lot of time with them.
And you know what they said to us?
They said, let us win.
They said, let us win.
We don't want our kids coming back here.
And this strategy, and this general, they are winning.
Senator Obama refuses to acknowledge that we are winning in Iraq.
That's not true.
They just passed an electoral...
That's not true.
An election law just in the last few days.
There is social, economic progress, and a strategy, a strategy of going into an area, clearing and holding, and the people of the country then become allied with you.
They inform on the bad guys.
And peace comes to the country, and prosperity.
That's what's happening in Iraq, and it wasn't a tactic.
Let me see...
Jim, Jim, this is a big...
It was a strategy.
And that same strategy will be employed in Afghanistan by this great general.
And Senator Obama, who after promising not to vote to cut off funds for the troops, did the incredible thing of voting to cut off the funds for the troops in Iraq and Afghanistan.
Jim, there are a whole bunch of things we have got to answer.
First of all, let's talk about this troop funding issue because John always brings this up.
Senator McCain cut -- Senator McCain opposed funding for troops in legislation that had a timetable, because he didn't believe in a timetable.
I opposed funding a mission that had no timetable, and was open- ended, giving a blank check to George Bush.
We had a difference on the timetable.
We didn't have a difference on whether or not we were going to be funding troops.
We had a legitimate difference, and I absolutely understand the difference between tactics and strategy.
And the strategic question that the president has to ask is not whether or not we are employing a particular approach in the country once we have made the decision to be there.
The question is, was this wise?
We have seen Afghanistan worsen, deteriorate.
We need more troops there.
We need more resources there.
Senator McCain, in the rush to go into Iraq, said, you know what?
We've been successful in Afghanistan.
There is nobody who can pose a threat to us there.
This is a time when bin Laden was still out, and now they've reconstituted themselves.
Secretary of Defense Robert Gates himself acknowledges the war on terrorism started in Afghanistan and it needs to end there.
But we can't do it if we are not willing to give Iraq back its country.
Now, what I've said is we should end this war responsibly.
We should do it in phases.
But in 16 months we should be able to reduce our combat troops, put -- provide some relief to military families and our troops and bolster our efforts in Afghanistan so that we can capture and kill bin Laden and crush al Qaeda.
And right now, the commanders in Afghanistan, as well as Admiral Mullen, have acknowledged that we don't have enough troops to deal with Afghanistan because we still have more troops in Iraq than we did before the surge.
Admiral Mullen suggests that Senator Obama's plan is dangerous for America.
That's not the case.
That's what ...
What he said was a precipitous...
That's what Admiral Mullen said.
... withdrawal would be dangerous.
He did not say that.
That's not true.
And also General Petraeus said the same thing.
Osama bin Laden and General Petraeus have one thing in common that I know of, they both said that Iraq is the central battleground.
Now General Petraeus has praised the successes, but he said those successes are fragile and if we set a specific date for withdrawal -- and by the way, Senator Obama's original plan, they would have been out last spring before the surge ever had a chance to succeed.
And I'm -- I'm -- understand why Senator Obama was surprised and said that the surge succeeded beyond his wildest expectations.
It didn't exceed beyond mine, because I know that that's a strategy that has worked and can succeed.
But if we snatch defeat from the jaws of victory and adopt Senator Obama's plan, then we will have a wider war and it will make things more complicated throughout the region, including in Afghanistan.
Afghanistan, lead -- a new -- a new lead question.
Now, having resolved Iraq, we'll move to Afghanistan.
(LAUGHTER)  And it goes to you, Senator Obama, and it's a -- it picks up on a point that's already been made.
Do you think more troops -- more U.S. troops should be sent to Afghanistan, how many, and when?
Yes, I think we need more troops.
I've been saying that for over a year now.
And I think that we have to do it as quickly as possible, because it's been acknowledged by the commanders on the ground the situation is getting worse, not better.
We had the highest fatalities among U.S. troops this past year than at any time since 2002.
And we are seeing a major offensive taking place -- Al Qaida and Taliban crossing the border and attacking our troops in a brazen fashion.
They are feeling emboldened.
And we cannot separate Afghanistan from Iraq, because what our commanders have said is we don't have the troops right now to deal with Afghanistan.
So I would send two to three additional brigades to Afghanistan.
Now, keep in mind that we have four times the number of troops in Iraq, where nobody had anything to do with 9/11 before we went in, where, in fact, there was no Al Qaida before we went in, but we have four times more troops there than we do in Afghanistan.
And that is a strategic mistake, because every intelligence agency will acknowledge that Al Qaida is the greatest threat against the United States and that Secretary of Defense Gates acknowledged the central front -- that the place where we have to deal with these folks is going to be in Afghanistan and in Pakistan.
So here's what we have to do comprehensively, though.
It's not just more troops.
We have to press the Afghan government to make certain that they are actually working for their people.
And I've said this to President Karzai.
Number two, we've got to deal with a growing poppy trade that has exploded over the last several years.
Number three, we've got to deal with Pakistan, because Al Qaida and the Taliban have safe havens in Pakistan, across the border in the northwest regions, and although, you know, under George Bush, with the support of Senator McCain, we've been giving them $10 billion over the last seven years, they have not done what needs to be done to get rid of those safe havens.
And until we do, Americans here at home are not going to be safe.
Afghanistan, Senator McCain?
First of all, I won't repeat the mistake that I regret enormously, and that is, after we were able to help the Afghan freedom fighters and drive the Russians out of Afghanistan, we basically washed our hands of the region.
And the result over time was the Taliban, Al Qaida, and a lot of the difficulties we are facing today.
So we can't ignore those lessons of history.
Now, on this issue of aiding Pakistan, if you're going to aim a gun at somebody, George Shultz, our great secretary of state, told me once, you'd better be prepared to pull the trigger.
I'm not prepared at this time to cut off aid to Pakistan.
So I'm not prepared to threaten it, as Senator Obama apparently wants to do, as he has said that he would announce military strikes into Pakistan.
We've got to get the support of the people of -- of Pakistan.
He said that he would launch military strikes into Pakistan.
Now, you don't do that.
You don't say that out loud.
If you have to do things, you have to do things, and you work with the Pakistani government.
Now, the new president of Pakistan, Kardari (sic), has got his hands full.
And this area on the border has not been governed since the days of Alexander the Great.
I've been to Waziristan.
I can see how tough that terrain is.
It's ruled by a handful of tribes.
And, yes, Senator Obama calls for more troops, but what he doesn't understand, it's got to be a new strategy, the same strategy that he condemned in Iraq.
It's going to have to be employed in Afghanistan.
And we're going to have to help the Pakistanis go into these areas and obtain the allegiance of the people.
And it's going to be tough.
They've intermarried with Al Qaida and the Taliban.
And it's going to be tough.
But we have to get the cooperation of the people in those areas.
And the Pakistanis are going to have to understand that that bombing in the Marriott Hotel in Islamabad was a signal from the terrorists that they don't want that government to cooperate with us in combating the Taliban and jihadist elements.
So we've got a lot of work to do in Afghanistan.
But I'm confident, now that General Petraeus is in the new position of command, that we will employ a strategy which not only means additional troops -- and, by the way, there have been 20,000 additional troops, from 32,000 to 53,000, and there needs to be more.
So it's not just the addition of troops that matters.
It's a strategy that will succeed.
And Pakistan is a very important element in this.
And I know how to work with them.
And I guarantee you I would not publicly state that I'm going to attack them.
Nobody talked about attacking Pakistan.
Here's what I said.
And if John wants to disagree with this, he can let me know, that, if the United States has Al Qaida, bin Laden, top-level lieutenants in our sights, and Pakistan is unable or unwilling to act, then we should take them out.
Now, I think that's the right strategy; I think that's the right policy.
And, John, I -- you're absolutely right that presidents have to be prudent in what they say.
But, you know, coming from you, who, you know, in the past has threatened extinction for North Korea and, you know, sung songs about bombing Iran, I don't know, you know, how credible that is.
I think this is the right strategy.
Now, Senator McCain is also right that it's difficult.
This is not an easy situation.
You've got cross-border attacks against U.S. troops.
And we've got a choice.
We could allow our troops to just be on the defensive and absorb those blows again and again and again, if Pakistan is unwilling to cooperate, or we have to start making some decisions.
And the problem, John, with the strategy that's been pursued was that, for 10 years, we coddled Musharraf, we alienated the Pakistani population, because we were anti-democratic.
We had a 20th-century mindset that basically said, "Well, you know, he may be a dictator, but he's our dictator."
And as a consequence, we lost legitimacy in Pakistan.
We spent $10 billion.
And in the meantime, they weren't going after Al Qaida, and they are more powerful now than at any time since we began the war in Afghanistan.
That's going to change when I'm president of the United States.
I -- I don't think that Senator Obama understands that there was a failed state in Pakistan when Musharraf came to power.
Everybody who was around then, and had been there, and knew about it knew that it was a failed state.
But let me tell you, you know, this business about bombing Iran and all that, let me tell you my record.
Back in 1983, when I was a brand-new United States congressman, the one -- the person I admired the most and still admire the most, Ronald Reagan, wanted to send Marines into Lebanon.
And I saw that, and I saw the situation, and I stood up, and I voted against that, because I was afraid that they couldn't make peace in a place where 300 or 400 or several hundred Marines would make a difference.
Tragically, I was right: Nearly 300 Marines lost their lives in the bombing of the barracks.
And then we had Somalia -- then we had the first Gulf War.
I supported -- I supported that.
I supported us going into Bosnia, when a number of my own party and colleagues was against that operation in Bosnia.
That was the right thing to do, to stop genocide and to preserve what was necessary inside of Europe.
I supported what we did in Kosovo.
I supported it because ethnic cleansing and genocide was taking place there.
And I have a record -- and Somalia, I opposed that we should turn -- turn the force in Somalia from a peacekeeping force into a peacemaking force, which they were not capable of.
So I have a record.
I have a record of being involved in these national security issues, which involve the highest responsibility and the toughest decisions that any president can make, and that is to send our young men and women into harm's way.
And I'll tell you, I had a town hall meeting in Wolfeboro, New Hampshire, and a woman stood up and she said, "Senator McCain, I want you to do me the honor of wearing a bracelet with my son's name on it."
He was 22 years old and he was killed in combat outside of Baghdad, Matthew Stanley, before Christmas last year.
This was last August, a year ago.
And I said, "I will -- I will wear his bracelet with honor."
And this was August, a year ago.
And then she said, "But, Senator McCain, I want you to do everything -- promise me one thing, that you'll do everything in your power to make sure that my son's death was not in vain."
That means that that mission succeeds, just like those young people who re-enlisted in Baghdad, just like the mother I met at the airport the other day whose son was killed.
And they all say to me that we don't want defeat.
I know what thatâ€™s like when an army is defeated.
A war that I was in, where we had an Army, that it wasn't through any fault of their own, but they were defeated.
And I know how hard it is for that -- for an Army and a military to recover from that.
And it did and we will win this one and we won't come home in defeat and dishonor and probably have to go back if we fail.
Jim, let me just make a point.
I've got a bracelet, too, from Sergeant - from the mother of Sergeant Ryan David Jopeck (ph), given to me in green bay.
She asked me, can you please make sure another mother is not going through what I'm going through.
No U.S. soldier ever dies in vain because they're carrying out the missions of their commander in chief.
And we honor all the service that they've provided.
Our troops have performed brilliantly.
The question is for the next president, are we making good judgments about how to keep America safe precisely because sending our military into battle is such an enormous step.
And the point that I originally made is that we took our eye off Afghanistan, we took our eye off the folks who perpetrated 9/11, they are still sending out videotapes and Senator McCain, nobody is talking about defeat in Iraq, but I have to say we are having enormous problems in Afghanistan because of that decision.
And it is not true you have consistently been concerned about what happened in Afghanistan.
At one point,
