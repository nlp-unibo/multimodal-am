with what he just said?
No, actually, I think Senator McCain and I agree for the most part on these issues.
Obviously, I disagree with this notion that somehow we did not forcefully object to Russians going into Georgia.
I immediately said that this was illegal and objectionable.
And, absolutely, I wanted a cessation of the violence, because it put an enormous strain on Georgia, and that's why I was the first to say that we have to rebuild the Georgian economy and called for a billion dollars that has now gone in to help them rebuild.
Because part of Russia's intentions here was to weaken the economy to the point where President Saakashvili was so weakened that he might be replaced by somebody that Putin favored more.
Two points I think are important to think about when it comes to Russia.
Number one is we have to have foresight and anticipate some of these problems.
So back in April, I warned the administration that you had Russian peacekeepers in Georgian territory.
That made no sense whatsoever.
And what we needed to do was replace them with international peacekeepers and a special envoy to resolve the crisis before it boiled over.
That wasn't done.
But had it been done, it's possible we could have avoided the issue.
The second point I want to make is -- is the issue of energy.
Russia is in part resurgent and Putin is feeling powerful because of petro-dollars, as Senator McCain mentioned.
That means that we, as one of the biggest consumers of oil -- 25 percent of the world's oil -- have to have an energy strategy not just to deal with Russia, but to deal with many of the rogue states we've talked about, Iran, Venezuela.
And that means, yes, increasing domestic production and off-shore drilling, but we only have 3 percent of the world's oil supplies and we use 25 percent of the world's oil.
So we can't simply drill our way out of the problem.
What we're going to have to do is to approach it through alternative energy, like solar, and wind, and biodiesel, and, yes, nuclear energy, clean-coal technology.
And, you know, I've got a plan for us to make a significant investment over the next 10 years to do that.
And I have to say, Senator McCain and I, I think agree on the importance of energy, but Senator McCain mentioned earlier the importance of looking at a record.
Over 26 years, Senator McCain voted 23 times against alternative energy, like solar, and wind, and biodiesel.
And so we -- we -- we've got to walk the walk and not just talk the talk when it comes to energy independence, because this is probably going to be just as vital for our economy and the pain that people are feeling at the pump -- and, you know, winter's coming and home heating oil -- as it is our national security and the issue of climate change that's so important.
We've got time for one more lead question segment.
We're way out of... (CROSSTALK)
Quick response and then... (CROSSTALK)
No one from Arizona is against solar.
And Senator Obama says he's for nuclear, but he's against reprocessing and he's against storing.
So...
That's just not true, John.
John, I'm sorry, but that's not true.
... it's hard to get there from here.
And off-shore drilling is also something that is very important and it is a bridge.
And we know that, if we drill off-shore and exploit a lot of these reserves, it will help, at temporarily, relieve our energy requirements.
And it will have, I think, an important effect on the price of a barrel of oil.
I just have to respond very quickly, just to correct -- just to correct the record.
So I want to say that, with the Nunn-Lugar thing...
Excuse me, Senator.
John?
...
I supported Nunn-Lugar back in the early 1990s when a lot of my colleagues didn't.
That was the key legislation at the time and put us on the road to eliminating this issue of nuclear waste and the nuclear fuel that has to be taken care of.
I -- I just have to correct the record here.
I have never said that I object to nuclear waste.
What I've said is that we have to store it safely.
And, Senator McCain, he says -- he talks about Arizona.
All right.
I've got to make this point, Jim.
OK.
He objects...
I have voted for alternate fuel all of my time...
He -- he -- he objects... (CROSSTALK)
One at a time, please.
He objected...
One at a time.
No one can be opposed to alternate energy.
All right, fair enough.
Let's move on.
You've got one more energy -- you've got one more question.
This is the last -- last lead question.
You have two minutes each.
And the question is this, beginning with you, Senator McCain.
What do you think the likelihood is that there would be another 9/11-type attack on the continental United States?
I think it's much less than it was the day after 9/11.
I think it -- that we have a safer nation, but we are a long way from safe.
And I want to tell you that one of the things I'm most proud of, among others, because I have worked across the aisle.
I have a long record on that, on a long series of reforms.
But after 9/11, Senator Joe Lieberman and I decided that we needed a commission, and that was a commission to investigate 9/11, and find out what happened, and fix it.
And we were -- we were opposed by the administration, another area where I differed with this administration.
And we were stymied until the families of 9/11 came, and they descended on Washington, and we got that legislation passed.
And there were a series of recommendations, as I recall, more than 40.
And I'm happy to say that we've gotten written into law most of those reforms recommended by that commission.
I'm proud of that work, again, bipartisan, reaching across the aisle, working together, Democrat and Republican alike.
So we have a long way to go in our intelligence services.
We have to do a better job in human intelligence.
And we've got to -- to make sure that we have people who are trained interrogators so that we don't ever torture a prisoner ever again.
We have to make sure that our technological and intelligence capabilities are better.
We have to work more closely with our allies.
I know our allies, and I can work much more closely with them.
But I can tell you that I think America is safer today than it was on 9/11.
But that doesn't mean that we don't have a long way to go.
And I'd like to remind you, also, as a result of those recommendations, we've probably had the largest reorganization of government since we established the Defense Department.
And I think that those men and women in those agencies are doing a great job.
But we still have a long way to go before we can declare America safe, and that means doing a better job along our borders, as well.
Two minutes, Senator Obama.
Well, first of all, I think that we are safer in some ways.
Obviously, we've poured billions of dollars into airport security.
We have done some work in terms of securing potential targets, but we still have a long way to go.
We've got to make sure that we're hardening our chemical sites.
We haven't done enough in terms of transit; we haven't done enough in terms of ports.
And the biggest threat that we face right now is not a nuclear missile coming over the skies.
It's in a suitcase.
This is why the issue of nuclear proliferation is so important.
It is the -- the biggest threat to the United States is a terrorist getting their hands on nuclear weapons.
And we -- we are spending billions of dollars on missile defense.
And I actually believe that we need missile defense, because of Iran and North Korea and the potential for them to obtain or to launch nuclear weapons, but I also believe that, when we are only spending a few hundred million dollars on nuclear proliferation, then we're making a mistake.
The other thing that we have to focus on, though, is Al Qaida.
They are now operating in 60 countries.
We can't simply be focused on Iraq.
We have to go to the root cause, and that is in Afghanistan and Pakistan.
That's going to be critical.
We are going to need more cooperation with our allies.
And one last point I want to make.
It is important for us to understand that the way we are perceived in the world is going to make a difference, in terms of our capacity to get cooperation and root out terrorism.
And one of the things that I intend to do as president is to restore America's standing in the world.
We are less respected now than we were eight years ago or even four years ago.
And this is the greatest country on Earth.
But because of some of the mistakes that have been made -- and I give Senator McCain great credit on the torture issue, for having identified that as something that undermines our long-term security -- because of those things, we, I think, are going to have a lot of work to do in the next administration to restore that sense that America is that shining beacon on a hill.
Do you agree there's much to be done in a new administration to restore... (CROSSTALK)
But in the case of missile defense, Senator Obama said it had to be, quote, "proven."
That wasn't proven when Ronald Reagan said we would do SDI, which is missile defense.
And it was major -- a major factor in bringing about the end of the Cold War.
We seem to come full circle again.
Senator Obama still doesn't quite understand -- or doesn't get it -- that if we fail in Iraq, it encourages Al Qaida.
They would establish a base in Iraq.
The consequences of defeat, which would result from his plan of withdrawal and according to date certain, regardless of conditions, according to our military leaders, according to every expert, would lead to defeat -- possible defeat, loss of all the fragile sacrifice that we've made of American blood and treasure, which grieves us all.
All of that would be lost if we followed Senator Obama's plan to have specific dates with withdrawal, regardless of conditions on the ground.
And General Petraeus says we have had great success, but it's very fragile.
And we can't do what Senator Obama wants to do.
That is the central issue of our time.
And I think Americans will judge very seriously as to whether that's the right path or the wrong path and who should be the next president of the United States.
You see the same connections that Senator McCain does?
Oh, there's no doubt.
Look, over the last eight years, this administration, along with Senator McCain, have been solely focused on Iraq.
That has been their priority.
That has been where all our resources have gone.
In the meantime, bin Laden is still out there.
He is not captured.
He is not killed.
Al Qaida is resurgent.
In the meantime, we've got challenges, for example, with China, where we are borrowing billions of dollars.
They now hold a trillion dollars' worth of our debt.
And they are active in countries like -- in regions like Latin America, and Asia, and Africa.
They are -- the conspicuousness of their presence is only matched by our absence, because we've been focused on Iraq.
We have weakened our capacity to project power around the world because we have viewed everything through this single lens, not to mention, look at our economy.
We are now spending $10 billion or more every month.
And that means we can't provide health care to people who need it.
We can't invest in science and technology, which will determine whether or not we are going to be competitive in the long term.
There has never been a country on Earth that saw its economy decline and yet maintained its military superiority.
So this is a national security issue.
We haven't adequately funded veterans' care.
I sit on the Veterans Affairs Committee, and we've got -- I meet veterans all across the country who are trying to figure out, "How can I get disability payments?
I've got post-traumatic stress disorder, and yet I can't get treatment."
So we have put all chips in, right there, and nobody is talking about losing this war.
What we are talking about is recognizing that the next president has to have a broader strategic vision about all the challenges that we face.
That's been missing over the last eight years.
That sense is something that I want to restore.
I've been involved, as I mentioned to you before, in virtually every major national security challenge we've faced in the last 20-some years.
There are some advantages to experience, and knowledge, and judgment.
And I -- and I honestly don't believe that Senator Obama has the knowledge or experience and has made the wrong judgments in a number of areas, including his initial reaction to Russian invasion -- aggression in Georgia, to his -- you know, we've seen this stubbornness before in this administration to cling to a belief that somehow the surge has not succeeded and failing to acknowledge that he was wrong about the surge is -- shows to me that we -- that -- that we need more flexibility in a president of the United States than that.
As far as our other issues that he brought up are concerned, I know the veterans.
I know them well.
And I know that they know that I'll take care of them.
And I've been proud of their support and their recognition of my service to the veterans.
And I love them.
And I'll take care of them.
And they know that I'll take care of them.
And that's going to be my job.
But, also, I have the ability, and the knowledge, and the background to make the right judgments, to keep this country safe and secure.
Reform, prosperity, and peace, these are major challenges to the United States of America.
I don't think I need any on-the-job training.
I'm ready to go at it right now.
Well, let me just make a closing point.
You know, my father came from Kenya.
That's where I get my name.
And in the '60s, he wrote letter after letter to come to college here in the United States because the notion was that there was no other country on Earth where you could make it if you tried.
The ideals and the values of the United States inspired the entire world.
I don't think any of us can say that our standing in the world now, the way children around the world look at the United States, is the same.
And part of what we need to do, what the next president has to do -- and this is part of our judgment, this is part of how we're going to keep America safe -- is to -- to send a message to the world that we are going to invest in issues like education, we are going to invest in issues that -- that relate to how ordinary people are able to live out their dreams.
And that is something that I'm going to be committed to as president of the United States.
Few seconds.
We're almost finished.
Jim, when I came home from prison, I saw our veterans being very badly treated, and it made me sad.
And I embarked on an effort to resolve the POW-MIA issue, which we did in a bipartisan fashion, and then I worked on normalization of relations between our two countries so that our veterans could come all the way home.
I guarantee you, as president of the United States, I know how to heal the wounds of war, I know how to deal with our adversaries, and I know how to deal with our friends.
