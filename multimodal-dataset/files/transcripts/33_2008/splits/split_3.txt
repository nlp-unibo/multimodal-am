while you were focused on Iraq, you said well, we can "muddle through" Afghanistan.
You don't muddle through the central front on terror and you don't muddle through going after bin Laden.
You don't muddle through stamping out the Taliban.
I think that is something we have to take seriously.
And when I'm president, I will.
New ...
You might think that with that kind of concern that Senator Obama would have gone to Afghanistan, particularly given his responsibilities as a subcommittee chairman.
By the way, when I'm subcommittee chairman, we take up the issues under my subcommittee.
But the important thing is -- the important thing is I visited Afghanistan and I traveled to Waziristan and I traveled to these places and I know what our security requirements are.
I know what our needs are.
So the point is that we will prevail in Afghanistan, but we need the new strategy and we need it to succeed.
But the important thing is, if we suffer defeat in Iraq, which General Petraeus predicts we will, if we adopted Senator Obama's set date for withdrawal, then that will have a calamitous effect in Afghanistan and American national security interests in the region.
Senator Obama doesn't seem to understand there is a connected between the two.
I have some good news and bad news for the two of you.
You all are even on time, which is remarkable, considering we've been going at it ...
A testimony to you, Jim.
I don't know about that.
But the bad news is all my little five minute things have run over, so, anyhow, we'll adjust as we get there.
But the amount of time is even.
New lead question.
And it goes two minutes to you, Senator McCain, what is your reading on the threat from Iran right now to the security of the United States?
My reading of the threat from Iran is that if Iran acquires nuclear weapons, it is an existential threat to the State of Israel and it is a threat to other countries in the region because the other countries in the region will feel compelling requirement to acquire nuclear weapons as well.
Now we cannot allow a second Holocaust.
Let's just make that very clear.
What I have proposed for a long time, and I've had conversation with foreign leaders about forming a league of democracies, let's be clear and let's have some straight talk.
The Russians are preventing significant action in the United Nations Security Council.
I have proposed a league of democracies, a group of people - a group of countries that share common interests, common values, common ideals, they also control a lot of the world's economic power.
We could impose significant meaningful, painful sanctions on the Iranians that I think could have a beneficial effect.
The Iranians have a lousy government, so therefore their economy is lousy, even though they have significant oil revenues.
So I am convinced that together, we can, with the French, with the British, with the Germans and other countries, democracies around the world, we can affect Iranian behavior.
But have no doubt, but have no doubt that the Iranians continue on the path to the acquisition of a nuclear weapon as we speak tonight.
And it is a threat not only in this region but around the world.
What I'd also like to point out the Iranians are putting the most lethal IEDs into Iraq which are killing young Americans, there are special groups in Iran coming into Iraq and are being trained in Iran.
There is the Republican Guard in Iran, which Senator Kyl had an amendment in order to declare them a sponsor of terror.
Senator Obama said that would be provocative.
So this is a serious threat.
This is a serious threat to security in the world, and I believe we can act and we can act with our friends and allies and reduce that threat as quickly as possible, but have no doubt about the ultimate result of them acquiring nuclear weapons.
Two minutes on Iran, Senator Obama.
Well, let me just correct something very quickly.
I believe the Republican Guard of Iran is a terrorist organization.
I've consistently said so.
What Senator McCain refers to is a measure in the Senate that would try to broaden the mandate inside of Iraq.
To deal with Iran.
And ironically, the single thing that has strengthened Iran over the last several years has been the war in Iraq.
Iraq was Iran's mortal enemy.
That was cleared away.
And what we've seen over the last several years is Iran's influence grow.
They have funded Hezbollah, they have funded Hamas, they have gone from zero centrifuges to 4,000 centrifuges to develop a nuclear weapon.
So obviously, our policy over the last eight years has not worked.
Senator McCain is absolutely right, we cannot tolerate a nuclear Iran.
It would be a game changer.
Not only would it threaten Israel, a country that is our stalwart ally, but it would also create an environment in which you could set off an arms race in this Middle East.
Now here's what we need to do.
We do need tougher sanctions.
I do not agree with Senator McCain that we're going to be able to execute the kind of sanctions we need without some cooperation with countries like Russia and China that are, I think Senator McCain would agree, not democracies, but have extensive trade with Iran but potentially have an interest in making sure Iran doesn't have a nuclear weapon.
But we are also going to have to, I believe, engage in tough direct diplomacy with Iran and this is a major difference I have with Senator McCain, this notion that by not talking to people we are punishing them has not worked.
It has not worked in Iran, it has not worked in North Korea.
In each instance, our efforts at isolation have actually accelerated their efforts to get nuclear weapons.
That will change when I'm president of the United States.
Senator, what about talking?
Senator Obama twice said in debates he would sit down with Ahmadinejad, Chavez and Raul Castro without precondition.
Without precondition.
Here is Ahmadinenene (ph), Ahmadinejad, who is, Ahmadinejad, who is now in New York, talking about the extermination of the State of Israel, of wiping Israel off the map, and we're going to sit down, without precondition, across the table, to legitimize and give a propaganda platform to a person that is espousing the extermination of the state of Israel, and therefore then giving them more credence in the world arena and therefore saying, they've probably been doing the right thing, because you will sit down across the table from them and that will legitimize their illegal behavior.
The point is that throughout history, whether it be Ronald Reagan, who wouldn't sit down with Brezhnev, Andropov or Chernenko until Gorbachev was ready with glasnost and perestroika.
Or whether it be Nixon's trip to China, which was preceded by Henry Kissinger, many times before he went.
Look, I'll sit down with anybody, but there's got to be pre-conditions.
Those pre-conditions would apply that we wouldn't legitimize with a face to face meeting, a person like Ahmadinejad.
Now, Senator Obama said, without preconditions.
So let's talk about this.
First of all, Ahmadinejad is not the most powerful person in Iran.
So he may not be the right person to talk to.
But I reserve the right, as president of the United States to meet with anybody at a time and place of my choosing if I think it's going to keep America safe.
And I'm glad that Senator McCain brought up the history, the bipartisan history of us engaging in direct diplomacy.
Senator McCain mentioned Henry Kissinger, who's one of his advisers, who, along with five recent secretaries of state, just said that we should meet with Iran -- guess what -- without precondition.
This is one of your own advisers.
Now, understand what this means "without preconditions."
It doesn't mean that you invite them over for tea one day.
What it means is that we don't do what we've been doing, which is to say, "Until you agree to do exactly what we say, we won't have direct contacts with you."
There's a difference between preconditions and preparation.
Of course we've got to do preparations, starting with low-level diplomatic talks, and it may not work, because Iran is a rogue regime.
But I will point out that I was called naive when I suggested that we need to look at exploring contacts with Iran.
And you know what?
President Bush recently sent a senior ambassador, Bill Burns, to participate in talks with the Europeans around the issue of nuclear weapons.
Again, it may not work, but if it doesn't work, then we have strengthened our ability to form alliances to impose the tough sanctions that Senator McCain just mentioned.
And when we haven't done it, as in North Korea -- let me just take one more example -- in North Korea, we cut off talks.
They're a member of the axis of evil.
We can't deal with them.
And you know what happened?
They went -- they quadrupled their nuclear capacity.
They tested a nuke.
They tested missiles.
They pulled out of the nonproliferation agreement.
And they sent nuclear secrets, potentially, to countries like Syria.
When we re-engaged -- because, again, the Bush administration reversed course on this -- then we have at least made some progress, although right now, because of the problems in North Korea, we are seeing it on shaky ground.
And -- and I just -- so I just have to make this general point that the Bush administration, some of Senator McCain's own advisers all think this is important, and Senator McCain appears resistant.
He even said the other day that he would not meet potentially with the prime minister of Spain, because he -- you know, he wasn't sure whether they were aligned with us.
I mean, Spain?
Spain is a NATO ally.
Of course.
If we can't meet with our friends, I don't know how we're going to lead the world in terms of dealing with critical issues like terrorism.
I'm not going to set the White House visitors schedule before I'm president of the United States.
I don't even have a seal yet.
Look, Dr. Kissinger did not say that he would approve of face-to- face meetings between the president of the United States and the president -- and Ahmadinejad.
He did not say that.
Of course not.
He said that there could be secretary-level and lower level meetings.
I've always encouraged them.
The Iranians have met with Ambassador Crocker in Baghdad.
What Senator Obama doesn't seem to understand that if without precondition you sit down across the table from someone who has called Israel a "stinking corpse," and wants to destroy that country and wipe it off the map, you legitimize those comments.
This is dangerous.
It isn't just naive; it's dangerous.
And so we just have a fundamental difference of opinion.
As far as North Korea is concerned, our secretary of state, Madeleine Albright, went to North Korea.
By the way, North Korea, most repressive and brutal regime probably on Earth.
The average South Korean is three inches taller than the average North Korean, a huge gulag.
We don't know what the status of the dear leader's health is today, but we know this, that the North Koreans have broken every agreement that they've entered into.
And we ought to go back to a little bit of Ronald Reagan's "trust, but verify," and certainly not sit down across the table from -- without precondition, as Senator Obama said he did twice, I mean, it's just dangerous.
Look, I mean, Senator McCain keeps on using this example that suddenly the president would just meet with somebody without doing any preparation, without having low-level talks.
Nobody's been talking about that, and Senator McCain knows it.
This is a mischaracterization of my position.
When we talk about preconditions -- and Henry Kissinger did say we should have contacts without preconditions -- the idea is that we do not expect to solve every problem before we initiate talks.
And, you know, the Bush administration has come to recognize that it hasn't worked, this notion that we are simply silent when it comes to our enemies.
And the notion that we would sit with Ahmadinejad and not say anything while he's spewing his nonsense and his vile comments is ridiculous.
Nobody is even talking about that.
So let me get this right.
We sit down with Ahmadinejad, and he says, "We're going to wipe Israel off the face of the Earth," and we say, "No, you're not"?
Oh, please.
No, let me tell... (CROSSTALK)
By the way, my friend, Dr. Kissinger, who's been my friend for 35 years, would be interested to hear this conversation and Senator Obama's depiction of his -- of his positions on the issue.
I've known him for 35 years.
We will take a look.
And I guarantee you he would not -- he would not say that presidential top level.
Nobody's talking about that.
Of course he encourages and other people encourage contacts, and negotiations, and all other things.
We do that all the time.
We're going to go to a new... (CROSSTALK)
And Senator Obama is parsing words when he says precondition means preparation.
I am not parsing words.
He's parsing words, my friends.
I'm using the same words that your advisers use.
Please, go ahead.
New lead question.
Russia, goes to you, two minutes, Senator Obama.
How do you see the relationship with Russia?
Do you see them as a competitor?
Do you see them as an enemy?
Do you see them as a potential partner?
Well, I think that, given what's happened over the last several weeks and months, our entire Russian approach has to be evaluated, because a resurgent and very aggressive Russia is a threat to the peace and stability of the region.
Their actions in Georgia were unacceptable.
They were unwarranted.
And at this point, it is absolutely critical for the next president to make clear that we have to follow through on our six-party -- or the six-point cease-fire.
They have to remove themselves from South Ossetia and Abkhazia.
It is absolutely important that we have a unified alliance and that we explain to the Russians that you cannot be a 21st-century superpower, or power, and act like a 20th-century dictatorship.
And we also have to affirm all the fledgling democracies in that region, you know, the Estonians, the Lithuanians, the Latvians, the Poles, the Czechs, that we are, in fact, going to be supportive and in solidarity with them in their efforts.
They are members of NATO.
And to countries like Georgia and the Ukraine, I think we have to insist that they are free to join NATO if they meet the requirements, and they should have a membership action plan immediately to start bringing them in.
Now, we also can't return to a Cold War posture with respect to Russia.
It's important that we recognize there are going to be some areas of common interest.
One is nuclear proliferation.
They have not only 15,000 nuclear warheads, but they've got enough to make another 40,000, and some of those loose nukes could fall into the hands of Al Qaida.
This is an area where I've led on in the Senate, working with a Republican ranking member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Dick Lugar, to deal with the proliferation of loose nuclear weapons.
That's an area where we're going to have to work with Russia.
But we have to have a president who is clear that you don't deal with Russia based on staring into his eyes and seeing his soul.
You deal with Russia based on, what are your -- what are the national security interests of the United States of America?
And we have to recognize that the way they've been behaving lately demands a sharp response from the international community and our allies.
Two minutes on Russia, Senator McCain.
Well, I was interested in Senator Obama's reaction to the Russian aggression against Georgia.
His first statement was, "Both sides ought to show restraint."
Again, a little bit of naivete there.
He doesn't understand that Russia committed serious aggression against Georgia.
And Russia has now become a nation fueled by petro-dollars that is basically a KGB apparatchik-run government.
I looked into Mr. Putin's eyes, and I saw three letters, a "K," a "G," and a "B."
And their aggression in Georgia is not acceptable behavior.
I don't believe we're going to go back to the Cold War.
I am sure that that will not happen.
But I do believe that we need to bolster our friends and allies.
And that wasn't just about a problem between Georgia and Russia.
It had everything to do with energy.
There's a pipeline that runs from the Caspian through Georgia through Turkey.
And, of course, we know that the Russians control other sources of energy into Europe, which they have used from time to time.
It's not accidental that the presidents of Latvia, Estonia, Lithuania, Poland, and Ukraine flew to Georgia, flew to Tbilisi, where I have spent significant amount of time with a great young president, Misha Saakashvili.
And they showed solidarity with them, but, also, they are very concerned about the Russian threats to regain their status of the old Russian to regain their status of the old Russian empire.
Now, I think the Russians ought to understand that we will support -- we, the United States -- will support the inclusion of Georgia and Ukraine in the natural process, inclusion into NATO.
We also ought to make it very clear that the Russians are in violation of their cease-fire agreement.
They have stationed additional troops in Abkhazia and South Ossetia.
By the way, I went there once, and we went inside and drove in, and there was a huge poster.
And this is -- this is Georgian territory.
And there was a huge poster of Vladimir Putin, and it said, "Vladimir Putin, our president."
It was very clear, the Russian intentions towards Georgia.
They were just waiting to seize the opportunity.
So, this is a very difficult situation.
We want to work with the Russians.
But we also have every right to expect the Russians to behave in a fashion and keeping with a -- with a -- with a country who respects international boundaries and the norms of international behavior.
And watch Ukraine.
This whole thing has got a lot to do with Ukraine, Crimea, the base of the Russian fleet in Sevastopol.
And the breakdown of the political process in Ukraine between Tymoshenko and Yushchenko is a very serious problem.
So watch Ukraine, and let's make sure that we -- that the Ukrainians understand that we are their friend and ally.
You see any -- do you have a major difference
