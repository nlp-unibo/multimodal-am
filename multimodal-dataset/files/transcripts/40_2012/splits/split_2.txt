the American people safe?
That's exactly what our budget does, and it also then allows us to reduce our deficit, which is a significant national security concern.
Because we've got to make sure that our economy is strong at home so that we can project military power overseas.
I'm pleased that I've balanced budgets.
I was on the world of business for 25 years.
If you didn't balance your budget, you went out of business.
I went into the Olympics that was out of balance, and we got it on balance, and made a success there.
I had the chance to be governor of a state.
Four years in a row, Democrats and Republicans came together to balance the budget.
We cut taxes 19 times and balanced our budget.
The president hasn't balanced a budget yet.
I expect to have the opportunity to do so myself.
All right.
I'm going to be able to balance the budget.
Let's talk about military spending, and that's this.
(CROSSTALK)
Thirty seconds.
Our Navy is old -- excuse me, our Navy is smaller now than at any time since 1917.
The Navy said they needed 313 ships to carry out their mission.
We're now at under 285.
We're headed down to the low 200s if we go through a sequestration.
That's unacceptable to me.
I want to make sure that we have the ships that are required by our Navy.
Our Air Force is older and smaller than at any time since it was founded in 1947.
We've changed for the first time since FDR -- since FDR we had the -- we've always had the strategy of saying we could fight in two conflicts at once.
Now we're changing to one conflict.
Look, this, in my view, is the highest responsibility of the President of the United States, which is to maintain the safety of the American people.
And I will not cut our military budget by a trillion dollars, which is a combination of the budget cuts the president has, as well as the sequestration cuts.
That, in my view, is making -- is making our future less certain and less secure.
Bob, I just need to comment on this.
First of all, the sequester is not something that I've proposed.
It is something that Congress has proposed.
It will not happen.
The budget that we are talking about is not reducing our military spending.
It is maintaining it.
But I think Governor Romney maybe hasn't spent enough time looking at how our military works.
You mentioned the Navy, for example, and that we have fewer ships than we did in 1916.
Well, Governor, we also have fewer horses and bayonets, because the nature of our military's changed.
We have these things called aircraft carriers, where planes land on them.
We have these ships that go underwater, nuclear submarines.
And so the question is not a game of Battleship, where we're counting slips.
It's what are our capabilities.
And so when I sit down with the Secretary of the Navy and the Joint Chiefs of Staff, we determine how are we going to be best able to meet all of our defense needs in a way that also keeps faith with our troops, that also makes sure that our veterans have the kind of support that they need when they come home.
And that is not reflected in the kind of budget that you're putting forward because it just doesn't work.
All right.
And, you know, we visited the website quite a bit and it still doesn't work.
A lot to cover.
I'd like -- I'd like to move to the next segment: red lines, Israel and Iran.
Would either of you -- and you'll have two minutes -- and, President Obama, you have the first go at this one -- would either of you be willing to declare that an attack on Israel is an attack on the United States, which, of course, is the same promise that we give to our close allies like Japan.
And if you made such a declaration, would not that deter Iran?
It's certainly deterred the Soviet Union for a long, long time when we made that -- we made -- we made that promise to our allies.
Mr. President?
First of all, Israel is a true friend.
It is our greatest ally in the region.
And if Israel is attacked, America will stand with Israel.
I've made that clear throughout my presidency.
And...
So you're -- you're saying we've already made that declaration.
I will stand with Israel if they are attacked.
And this is the reason why, working with Israel, we have created the strongest military and intelligence cooperation between our two countries in history.
In fact, this week we'll be carrying out the largest military exercise with Israel in history, this very week.
But to the issue of Iran, as long as I'm president of the United States Iran will not get a nuclear weapon.
I made that clear when I came into office.
We then organized the strongest coalition and the strongest sanctions against Iran in history, and it is crippling their economy.
Their currency has dropped 80 percent.
Their oil production has plunged to the lowest level since they were fighting a war with Iraq 20 years ago.
So their economy is in a shambles.
And the reason we did this is because a nuclear Iran is a threat to our national security, and it is a threat to Israel's national security.
We cannot afford to have a nuclear arms race in the most volatile region of the world.
Iran is a state sponsor of terrorism.
And for them to be able to provide nuclear technology to non-state actors, that's unacceptable.
And they have said that they want to see Israel wiped off the map.
So the work that we've done with respect to sanctions now offers Iran a choice.
They can take the diplomatic route and end their nuclear program or they will have to face a united world and a United States president, me, who said we're not going to take any options off the table.
The disagreement I have with Governor Romney is that, during the course of this campaign, he's often talked as if we should take premature military action.
I think that would be a mistake, because when I've sent young men and women into harm's way, I always understand that that is the last resort, not the first resort.
Two minutes.
Well, first of all, I want to underscore the same point the president mad,e which is that if I'm President of the United States, when I'm President of the United States, we will stand with Israel.
And if Israel is attacked, we have their back, not just diplomatically, not just culturally, but militarily.
That's number one.
Number two, with regards to Iran and the threat of Iran, there's no question but that a nuclear Iran, a nuclear-capable Iran is unacceptable to America.
It presents a threat not only to our friends but ultimately a threat to us to have Iran have nuclear material, nuclear weapons that could be used against us or used to be threatening to us.
It is also essential for us to understand what our mission is in Iran, and that is to dissuade Iran from having a nuclear weapon through peaceful and diplomatic means.
And crippling sanctions are something I called for five years ago, when I was in Israel, speaking at the Herzliya Conference.
I laid out seven steps, crippling sanctions were number one.
And they do work.
You're seeing it right now in the economy.
It's absolutely the right thing to do, to have crippling sanctions.
I would have put them in place earlier.
But it's good that we have them.
Number two, something I would add today is I would tighten those sanctions.
I would say that ships that carry Iranian oil, can't come into our ports.
I imagine the E.U.
would agree with us as well.
Not only ships couldn't, but I'd say companies that are moving their oil can't, people who are trading in their oil can't.
I would tighten those sanctions further.
Secondly, I'd take on diplomatic isolation efforts.
I'd make sure that Ahmadinejad is indicted under the Genocide Convention.
His words amount to genocide incitation.
I would indict him for it.
I would also make sure that their diplomats are treated like the pariah they are around the world.
The same way we treated the apartheid diplomats of South Africa.
We need to increase pressure time, and time again on Iran because anything other than a -- a -- a solution to this, which says -- which stops this -- this nuclear folly of theirs, is unacceptable to America.
And of course, a military action is the last resort.
It is something one would only - only consider if all of the other avenues had been -- had been tried to their full extent.
Let me ask both of you, there -- as you know, there are reports that Iran and the United States a part of an international group, have agreed in principle to talks about Iran's nuclear program.
What is the deal, if there are such talks?
What is the deal that you would accept, Mr. President?
Well, first of all those are reports in the newspaper.
They are not true.
But our goal is to get Iran to recognize it needs to give up its nuclear program and abide by the U.N. resolutions that have been in place.
Because they have the opportunity to reenter the community of nations, and we would welcome that.
There -- there are people in Iran who have the same aspirations as people all around the world for a better life.
And we hope that their leadership takes the right decision, but the deal we'll accept is they end their nuclear program.
It's very straightforward.
And I'm glad that Governor Romney agrees with the steps that we're taking.
You know, there have been times, Governor, frankly, during the course of this campaign, where it sounded like you thought that you'd do the same things we did, but you'd say them louder and somehow that -- that would make a difference.
And it turns out that the work involved in setting up these crippling sanctions is painstaking.
It's meticulous.
We started from the day we got into office.
And the reason is was so important -- and this is a testament to how we've restored American credibility and strength around the world -- is we had to make sure that all the countries participated, even countries like Russia and China.
Because if it's just us that are imposing sanctions -- we've had sanctions in place a long time.
It's because we got everybody to agree that Iran is seeing so much pressure.
And we've got to maintain that pressure.
There is a deal to be had, and that is that they abide by the rules that have already been established.
They convince the international community they are not pursuing a nuclear program.
There are inspections that are very intrusive.
But over time, what they can do is regain credibility.
In the meantime, though, we're not going to let up the pressure until we have clear evidence that that takes place.
And one last thing -- just -- just to make this point.
The clock is ticking.
We're not going to allow Iran to perpetually engage in negotiations that lead nowhere.
And I've been very clear to them.
You know, because of the intelligence coordination that we do with a range of countries, including Israel, we have a sense of when they would get breakout capacity, which means that we would not be able to intervene in time to stop their nuclear program.
And that clock is ticking.
And we're going to make sure that if they do not meet the demands of the international community, then we are going to take all options necessary to make sure they don't have a nuclear weapon.
Governor?
I think from the very beginning, one of the challenges we've had with Iran is that they have looked at this administration, and felt that the administration was not as strong as it needed to be.
I think they saw weakness where they had expected to find American strength.
And I say that because from the very beginning, the president in his campaign four years ago, said he would meet with all the world's worst actors in his first year, he'd sit down with Chavez and Kim Jong-il, with Castro and President Ahmadinejad of Iran.
And I think they looked and thought, well, that's an unusual honor to receive from the President of the United States.
And then the president began what I have called an apology tour, of going to various nations in the Middle East and criticizing America.
I think they looked at that and saw weakness.
Then when there were dissidents in the streets of Tehran, a Green Revolution, holding signs saying, is America with us, the president was silent.
I think they noticed that as well.
And I think that when the president said he was going to create daylight between ourselves and Israel, that they noticed that as well.
All of these things suggested, I think, to the Iranian mullahs that, hey, you know, we can keep on pushing along here, we can keep talks going on, we're just going to keep on spinning centrifuges.
Now there are some 10,000 centrifuges spinning uranium, preparing to create a nuclear threat to the United States and to the world.
That's unacceptable for us, and it's essential for a president to show strength from the very beginning, to make it very clear what is acceptable and not acceptable.
And an Iranian nuclear program is not acceptable to us.
They must not develop nuclear capability.
And the way to make sure they understand that is by having, from the very beginning, the tightest sanctions possible.
They need to be tightened.
Our diplomatic isolation needs to be tougher.
We need to indict Ahmadinejad.
We need to put the pressure on them as hard as we possibly can, because if we do that, we won't have to take the military action.
Bob, let me just respond.
Nothing Governor Romney just said is true, starting with this notion of me apologizing.
This has been probably the biggest whopper that's been told during the course of this campaign.
And every fact checker and every reporter who's looked at it, Governor, has said this is not true.
And when it comes to tightening sanctions, look, as I said before, we've put in the toughest, most crippling sanctions ever.
And the fact is, while we were coordinating an international coalition to make sure these sanctions were effective, you were still invested in a Chinese state oil company that was doing business with the Iranian oil sector.
So I'll let the American people decide, judge, who's going to be more effective and more credible when it comes to imposing crippling sanctions.
And with respect to our attitude about the Iranian revolution, I was very clear about the murderous activities that had taken place and that was contrary to international law and everything that civilized people stand for.
And -- and so the strength that we have shown in Iran is shown by the fact that we've been able to mobilize the world.
When I came into office, the world was divided.
Iran was resurgent.
Iran is at its weakest point, economically, strategically, militarily, then since -- then in many years.
And we are going to continue to keep the pressure on to make sure that they do not get a nuclear weapon.
That's in America's national interest and that will be the case so long as I'm president.
We're four years closer to a nuclear Iran.
We're four years closer to a nuclear Iran.
And -- and -- we should not have wasted these four years to the extent they -- they continue to be able to spin these centrifuges and get that much closer.
That's number one.
Number two, Mr. President, the reason I call it an apology tour is because you went to the Middle East and you flew to Egypt and to Saudi Arabia and to Turkey and Iraq.
And by the way, you skipped Israel, our closest friend in the region, but you went to the other nations.
And by the way, they noticed that you skipped Israel.
And then in those nations, and on Arabic TV, you said that America had been dismissive and derisive.
You said that on occasion America had dictated to other nations.
Mr. President, America has not dictated to other nations.
We have freed other nations from dictators.
Bob, let me -- let me respond.
If we're going to talk about trips that we've taken -- when I was a candidate for office, first trip I took was to visit our troops.
And when I went to Israel as a candidate, I didn't take donors.
I didn't attend fundraisers.
I went to Yad Beshef (ph), the Holocaust museum there, to remind myself the nature of evil and why our bond with Israel will be unbreakable.
And then I went down to the border towns of Storok (ph), which had experienced missiles raining dowm from Hamas.
And I saw families there who showed me there where missiles had come down near their children's bedrooms.
And I was reminded of what that would mean if those were my kids.
Which is why as president, we funded an Iron Dome program to stop those missiles.
So that's how I've used my travels, when I travel to Israel and when I travel to the region.
And the -- the central question at this point is going to be: Who is going to be credible to all parties involved?
And they can look at my track record, whether it's Iran sanctions, whether it's dealing with counterterrorism, whether it's supporting democracy, whether it's supporting women's rights, whether it's supporting religious minorities.
And they can say that the President of the United States and the United States of America has stood on the right side of history.
And that kind of credibility is precisely why we've been able to show leadership on a wide range of issues facing the world right now.
What if -- what if the prime minister of Israel called you on the phone and said, "Our bombers are on the way.
We're going to bomb Iran."
What do you --
Bob, let's not go into hypotheticals of that nature.
Our relationship with Israel, my relationship with the prime minister of Israel is such that we would not get a call saying our bombers are on the way, or their fighters are on the way.
This is the kind of thing that would have been discussed and thoroughly evaluated well before that kind of -- (CROSSTALK)
So you'd say it just wouldn't happen?
That's --
OK. Let's see what --
But let me -- let me come back -- we can come back.
Let's come back to what the president was speaking about, which is what's happening in the world and the president's statement that things are going so well.
Look, I look at what's happening around the world, and i see Iran four years closer to a bomb.
I see the Middle East with a rising tide of violence, chaos, tumult.
I see jihadists continuing to spread, whether they're rising or just about the same level, hard to precisely measure, but it's clear they're there.
They're very strong.
I see Syria with 30,000 civilians dead, Assad still in power.
I see our trade deficit with China, larger than it's -- growing larger every year, as a matter of fact.
I look around the world and I don't feel that you see North Korea, continuing to export their nuclear technology, Russia said they're not going to follow Nunn-Lugar any more.
They're back away from a nuclear proliferation treaty that we had with them.
I look around the world, I don't see our influence growing around the world.
I see our influence receding, in part because of the failure of the president to deal with our economic challenges at home; in part because of our withdrawal from our commitment to our military in the way I think it ought to be; in part because of the -- the -- the turmoil with Israel.
I mean, the president received a letter from 38 Democrat senators saying the tensions with Israel were a real problem.
They asked him, please repair the tension -- Democrat senators -- please repair the tension...
All right.
... the damage in his -- in his own party.
Governor, the problem is, is that on a whole range of issues, whether it's the Middle East, whether it's Afghanistan, whether it's Iraq, whether it's now Iran, you've been all over the map.
I mean, I'm -- I'm pleased that you now are endorsing our policy of applying diplomatic pressure and potentially having bilateral discussions with the Iranians to end their nuclear program.
But just a few years ago you said that's something you'd never do.
In the same way that you initially opposed a timetable in Afghanistan, now you're for it, although it depends.
In the same way that you say you would have ended the war in Iraq, but recently gave a speech
