And that will always be the case as long as the Communists are on the international scene, in the aggressive tac- uh - tendencies that they presently are following.
Now as far as the present situation is concerned, I think it's time that we nail a few of these distortions about the United States that have been put out.
First of all, we hear that our prestige is at an all-time low.
Senator Kennedy has been hitting that point over and over again.
I would suggest that after Premier Kush- Khrushchev's uh - performance in the United Nations, compared with President Eisenhower's eloquent speech, that at the present time Communist prestige in the world is at an all-time low and American prestige is at an all-time high.
Now that, of course, is just one factor, but it's a significant one.
When we look, for example, at the vote on the Congo.
We were on one side; they were on the other side.
What happened?
There were seventy votes for our position and none for theirs.
Look at the votes in the United Nations over the past seven and a half years.
That's a test of prestige.
Every time the United States has been an one side and they've been on the other side, our position has been sustained.
Now looking to what we ought to do in the future.
In this cold war we have to recognize where it is being fought and then we have to develop programs to deal with it.
It's being fought primarily in Asia, in Africa, and in Latin America.
What do we need?
What tools do we need to fight us?
Well we need, for example, economic assistance; we need technical assistance; we need exchange; we need programs of diplomatic and other character which will be effective in that area.
Now Senator Kennedy a moment ago referred to the fact that there was not an adequate Voice of America program for Latin America.
I'd like to point out that in the last six years, the Democratic Congresses, of which he'd been a member, have cut twenty million dollars off of the Voice of America programs.
They also have cut four billion dollars off of mutual security in these last six years.
They also have cut two billion dollars off of defense.
Now when they talk about our record here, it is well that they recognize that they have to stand up for their record as well.
So let me summarize by saying this: I'm not satisfied with what we're doing in the cold war because I believe we have to step up our activities and launch an offensive for the minds and hearts and souls of men.
It must be economic; it must be technological; above all it must be ideological.
But we've got to get help from the Congress in order to do this.
Senator Kennedy.
Of course Mr. Nixon is wholly inaccurate when he says that the Congress has not provided more funds in fact than the President recommended for national defense.
Nineteen fifty-three we tried to put an appropriation of five billion dollars for our defenses.
I was responsible for the amendment with Senator Monroney in 1954 to strengthen our ground forces.
The Congress of the United States appropriated six hundred and seventy-seven million dollars mare than the President was willing to use up till a week ago.
Secondly, on the question of our position in the United Nations.
We all know about the vote held this week - of the five neutralists - and it was generally regarded as a defeat for the United States.
Thirdly, in 1952, there were only seven votes in favor of the admission of Red China into the United Nations.
Last year there were twenty-nine and tomorrow when the preliminary vote is held you will see a strengthening of that position or very closely to it.
We have not maintained our position and our prestige.
A Gallup Poll taken in February of this year asking the - in eight out of nine countries - they asked the people, who do they think would be ahead by 1970 militarily and scientifically, and a majority in eight of the nine countries said the Soviet Union would be by 1970.
Governor Rockefeller has been far more critical in June of our position in the world than I have been.
The Rockefeller Brothers report, General Ridgway, General Gavin, the Gaither Report, various reports of Congressional committees all indicate that the relative strength of the p- United States both militarily, politically, psychologically, and scientifically and industrially - the relative strength of the so- of United States compared to that of the Soviet Union and the Chinese Communists together - has deteriorated in the last eight years and we should know it, and the American people should be told the facts.
Mr. Spivak with a question for Senator Kennedy.
Senator, uh - following this up, how would you go about increasing the prestige you say we're losing, and could the programs you've devised to do so be accomplished without absolutely wrecking our economy?
Yes.
We have been wholly indifferent to Latin America until the last few months.
The program that was put forward this summer, after we broke off the sugar quota with Cuba, really was done because we wanted to get through the O.A.S.
meeting a condemnation of Russian infiltration of Cuba.
And therefore we passed an authorization - not an aid bill - which was the first time, really, since the Inter-American Bank which was founded a year ago was developed, that we really have looked at the needs of Latin America; that we have associated ourselves with those people.
Secondly, I believe that in the ca- that it's far better for the United States, instead of concentrating our aid, particularly in the underdeveloped world, on surplus military equipment - we poured three hundred million dollars of surplus military equipment into Laos.
We paid more military aid, more aid into Laos po- per - per person than in any country in the world and we ought to know now that Laos is moving from neutralism in the direction of the Communists.
I believe instead of doing that, we should concentrate our aid in long-term loans which these people can pay back either in hard money or in local currency.
This permits them to maintain their self-respect.
It permits us to make sure that the projects which are invested in are going to produce greater wealth.
And I believe that in cases of India and Africa and Latin America that this is where our emphasis should be.
I would strengthen the Development Loan Fund.
And Senator Fulbright, Senator Humphrey and I tried to do that.
We tried to provide an appropriation of a billion and a half for five years, on a long-term loan basis, which this Administration opposed.
And unless we're ready to carry out programs like that in the sixties, this battle for economic survival which these people are waging are going to be lost.
And if India should lose her battle, with thirty-five per cent of the people of the underdeveloped world within her borders, then I believe that the balance of power could move against us.
I think the United States can afford to do these things.
I think that we could not afford not to do these things.
This goes to our survival.
And here in a country which if it is moving ahead, if it's developing its economy to the fullest - which we are not now - in my judgment, we'll have the resources to meet our military commitments and also our commitments overseas.
I believe it's essential that we do it because in the next ten years the balance of power is going to begin to move in the world from one direction or another - towards us or towards the Communists - and unless we begin to identify ourselves not only with the anti-Communist fight, but also with the fight against poverty and hunger, these people are going to begin to turn to the Communists as an example.
I believe we can do it.
If we build our economy the way we should, we can afford to do these things and we must do it.
Mr. Vice President.
Senator Kennedy has put a great deal of stress on the necessity for economic assistance.
This is important.
But it's also tremendously important to bear in mind that when you pour in money without pouring in technical assistance at w- as well, that you have a disastrous situation.
We need to step up exchange; we need to step up technical assistance so that trained people in these newly developing countries can operate the economies.
We also have to have in mind something else with regard to this whole situation in the world, and that is: that as America moves forward, we not only must think in terms of fighting Communism, but we must also think primarily in terms of the interests of these countries.
We must associate ourselves with their aspirations.
We must let them know that the great American ideals - of independence, of the right of people to be free, and of the right to progress - that these are ideals that belong not to ourselves alone, but they belong to everybody.
This we must get across to the world.
And we can't do it unless we do have adequate funds for, for example, information which has been cut by the Congress, adequate funds for technical assistance.
The other point that I would make with regard to economic assistance and technical assistance is that the United States must not rest its case here alone.
This is primarily an ideological battle - a battle for the minds and the hearts and the souls of men.
We must not meet the Communists purely in the field of gross atheistic materialism.
We must stand for our ideals.
Mr. Levy with a question for Vice President Nixon.
Mr. Vice President, the Labor Department today added five more major industrial centers to the list of areas with substantial unemployment.
You said in New York this week that as president you would use the full powers of the government, if necessary, to combat unemployment.
Specifically what measures would you advocate and at what point?
To combat unemployment we first must concentrate on the very areas to which you refer - the so-called depressed areas.
Now in the last Congress - the special session of the Congress - there was a bill: one by the President, one by Senator Kennedy and members of his party.
Now the bill that the President had submitted would have provided more aid for those areas that really need it - areas like Scranton and Wilkes-Barre and the areas of West Virginia - than the ones that Senator Kennedy was supporting.
On the other hand we found that the bill got into the legislative difficulties and consequently no action was taken.
So point one, at the highest priority we must get a bill for depressed areas through the next Congress.
I have made recommendations on that and I have discussed them previously and I will spell them out further in the campaign.
Second, as we consider this problem of unemployment, we have to realize where it is.
In analyzing the figures we will find that our unemployment exists among the older citizens; it exists also among those who are inadequately trained; that is, those who do not have an adequate opportunity for education.
It also exists among minority groups.
If we're going to combat unemployment, then, we have to do a better job in these areas.
That's why I have a program for education, a program in the case of equal job opportunities, and one that would also deal with our older citizens.
Now finally, with regard to the whole problem of combating recession, as you call it, we must use the full resources of the government in these respects: one, we must see to it that credit is expanded as we go into any recessionary period - and understand, I do not believe we're going into a recession.
I believe this economy is sound and that we're going to move up.
But second, in addition to that, if we do get into a recessionary period we should move on that part of the economy which is represented by the private sector, and I mean stimulate that part of the economy that can create jobs - the private sector of the economy.
This means through tax reform and if necessary tax cuts that will stimulate more jobs.
I favor that rather than massive federal spending programs which will come into effect usually long after you've passed through the recessionary period.
So we must use all of these weapons for the purpose of combating recession if it should come.
But I do not expect it to come.
Senator Kennedy.
Well Mr. Nixon has stated the record inaccurately in regard to the depressed area bill.
I'm very familiar with it.
It came out of the committee of which I was the chairman - the labor subcommittee - in fifty-five.
I was the floor manager.
We passed an area redevelopment bill far more effective than the bill the Administration suggested, on two occasions, and the President vetoed it both times.
We passed a bill again this year in the cong- in the Senate and it died in the Rules Committee of the House of Representatives.
Let me make it very clear that the bill that Mr. Nixon talked about did not mention Wilkes-Barre or Scranton; it did not mention West Virginia.
Our bill was far more effective.
The bill introduced and erd- sponsored by Senator Douglas was far more effective in trying to stimulate the economy of those areas.
Secondly, he has mentioned the problem of our older citizens.
I cannot still understand why this Administration and Mr. Nixon oppose putting medical care for the aged under Social Security to give them some security.
Third, I believe we should step up the use of our surplus foods in these areas until we're able to get the people back to work.
Five cents a day - that's what the food package averages per person.
Fourthly, I believe we should not carry out a hard money, high interest rate policy which helped intensify certainly the recession of 1958, and I think helped bring the slow-down of 1960.
If we move into a recession in sixty-one, then I would agree that we have to put more money into the economy, and it can be done by either one of the two methods discussed.
One is by ex- the programs such as aid to education.
The other would be to make a judgment on what's the most effective tax program to stimulate our economy.
Mr. Niven with a question for Senator Kennedy.
Senator, while the main theme of your campaign has been this decline of American power and prestige in the last eight years, you've hardly criticized President Eisenhower at all.
And in a speech last weekend you said you had no quarrel with the President.
Now isn't Mr. Eisenhower and not Mr. Nixon responsible for any such decline?
Well I understood that this was the Eisenhower-Nixon Administration according to all the Republican uh - propaganda that I've read.
The question is what we're going to do in the future.
I've been critical of this Administration and I've been critical of the President.
In fact uh - Mr. Nixon uh - discussed that a week ago in a speech.
I believe that our power and prestige in the last eight years has declined.
Now what is the issue is what we're going to do in the future.
Now that's an issue between Mr. Nixon and myself.
He feels that we're moving ahead uh - in a - we're not going into a recession in this country, economically; he feels that our power and prestige is stronger than it ever was relative to that of the Communists, that we're moving ahead.
I disagree.
And I believe the American people have to make the choice on November eighth between the view of whether we have to move ahead faster, whether what we're doing now is not satisfactory, whether we have to build greater strength at home and abroad and Mr. Nixon's view.
That's the great issue.
President Eisenhower moves from the scene on January twentieth and the next four years are the critical years.
And that's the debate.
That's the argument between Mr. Nixon and myself and on that issue the American people have to make their judgment and I think it's a important judgment.
I think in many ways this election is more important than any since 1932, or certainly almost any in this century.
Because we disagree very fundamentally on the position of the United States, and if his view prevails then I think that's going to bring an important result to this country in the sixties.
If our view prevails that we have to do more, that we have to make a greater national and international effort, that we have lost prestige in Latin America - the President of Brazil - the new incumbent running for office called on Castro during his campaign because he thought it was important to get the vote of those who were supporting Castro in Latin America.
In Africa, the United States has ignored Latin uh - Africa.
We gave more scholarships to the Congo - this summer we offered them - than we've given to all of Africa the year before.
Less than two hundred for all the countries of Africa and they need trained leadership more than anything.
We've been uh - having a very clear decision in the last eight years.
Mr. Nixon has been part of that Administration.
He's had experience in it.
And I believe this Administration has not met its responsibilities in the last eight years, that our power relative to that of the Communists is declining, that we're facing a very hazardous time in the sixties, and unless the United States begin to move here - unless we start to go ahead - I don't believe that we're going to meet our responsibility to our own people or to the cause of freedom.
I think the choice is clear and it involves the future.
Mr. Vice President.
Well first of all, I think Senator Kennedy should make up his mind with regard to my responsibility.
In our first debate he indicated that I had not had experience or at least uh - had not participated significantly in the making of the decisions.
I'm glad to hear tonight that he does suggest that I have had some experience.
Let me make my position cl ear.
I have participated in the discussions leading to the decisions in this Administration.
I'm proud of the record of this Administration.
I don't stand on it because it isn't something to stand on but something to build on.
Now looking at Senator Kennedy's credentials: he is suggesting that he will move America faster and further than I will.
But what does he offer?
He offers retreads of programs that failed.
I submit to you that as you look at his programs, his program for example with regard to the Federal Reserve and uh - free money or loose money uh - high - low interest rates, his program in the economic field generally are the programs that were adopted and tried during the Truman Administration.
And when we compare the economic progress of this country in the Truman Administration with that of the Eisenhower Administration, we find that in every index there has been a tr- great deal more performance and more progress in this Administration than in that one.
I say the programs and the leadership that failed then is not the program and the leadership that America needs now.
I say that the American people don't want to go back to those policies.
And incidentally if Senator Kennedy disagrees, he should indicate where he believes those policies are different from those he's advocating today.
Mr. Spivak with a question for Vice President Nixon.
Mr. Vice President, according to news dispatches Soviet Premier Khrushchev said today that Prime Minister Macmillan had assured him that there would be a summit conference next year after the presidential elections.
Have you given any cause for such assurance, and do you consider it desirable or even possible that there would be a summit conference next year if Mr. Khrushchev persists in the conditions he's laid down?
No, of course I haven't talked to Prime Minister Macmillan.
It would not be appropriate for me to do so.
The President is still going to be president for the next four months and he, of course, is the only one who could commit this country in this period.
As far as a summit conference is concerned, I want to make my position absolutely clear.
I would be willing as president to meet with Mr. Khrushchev or any other world leader if it would serve the cause of peace.
I would not be able wou- would be willing to meet with him however, unless there were preparations for that conference which would give us some reasonable certainty - some reasonable certainty - that you were going to have some success.
We must not build up the hopes of the world and then dash them as was the case in Paris.
There, Mr. Khrushchev came to that conference determined to break it up.
He was going to break it up because he would - knew that he wasn't going to get his way on Berlin and on the other key matters with which he was concerned at the Paris Conference.
Now, if we're going to have another summit conference, there must be negotiations at the diplomatic level - the ambassadors, the Secretaries of State, and others at that level - prior to that time, which will delineate the issues and which will prepare the way for the heads of state to meet and make some progress.
Otherwise, if we find the heads of state meeting and not making progress, we will find that the cause of peace will have been hurt rather than helped.
So under these circumstances, I, therefore, strongly urge and I will strongly hold, if I have the opportunity to urge or to hold - this position: that any summit conference would be gone into only after the most careful preparation and only after Mr. Khrushchev - after his disgraceful conduct at Paris, after his disgraceful conduct at the United Nations - gave some assurance that he really wanted to sit down and talk and to accomplish something and not just to make propaganda.
Senator Kennedy.
I have no disagreement with the Vice President's position on that.
It - my view is the same as his.
