everything that has to be done to find terrorists, to keep the American people safe.
He laid out his plan for success in Iraq, made it clear that we were committed to success in Iraq.
We have to be, because we have troops on the ground there and because they have created a haven for terrorists.
Mr. Vice President, you have 30 seconds.
Your rhetoric, Senator, would be a lot more credible if there was a record to back it up.
There isn't.
And you cannot use "talk tough" during the course of a 90-minute debate in a presidential campaign to obscure a 30-year record in the United States Senate and, prior to that by John Kerry, who has consistently come down on the wrong side of all the major defense issues that he's faced as a public official.
Mr. Vice President, a new question for you.
You have two minutes to respond.
When the president says that Senator Kerry is emboldening enemies and you say that we could get hit again if voters make the wrong choice in November, are you saying that it would be a dangerous thing to have John Kerry as president?
I'm saying specifically that I don't believe he has the qualities we need in a commander in chief because I don't think, based on his record, that he would pursue the kind of aggressive policies that need to be pursued if we're going to defeat these terrorists.
We need to battle them overseas so we don't have to battle them here at home.
I'm not challenging John Kerry's patriotism.
I said in my acceptance speech in New York City at the Republican convention that we respected his service in Vietnam, and I got applause for that.
We've never criticized his patriotism.
What we've questioned is his judgment.
And his judgment's flawed, and the record's there for anybody who wants to look at it.
In 1984, when he ran for the Senate he opposed, or called for the elimination of a great many major weapons systems that were crucial to winning the Cold War and are important today to our overall forces.
When Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait and occupied it in 1990 and '91, he stood up on the floor of the Senate and voted against going in to liberate Kuwait and push Saddam Hussein back to Iraq.
The problem we have is that, if you look at his record, he doesn't display the qualities of somebody who has conviction.
And with respect to this particular operation, we've seen a situation in which, first, they voted to commit the troops, to send them to war, John Edwards and John Kerry, then they came back and when the question was whether or not you provide them with the resources they needed -- body armor, spare parts, ammunition -- they voted against it.
I couldn't figure out why that happened initially.
And then I looked and figured out that what was happening was Howard Dean was making major progress in the Democratic primaries, running away with the primaries based on an anti-war record.
So they, in effect, decided they would cast an anti-war vote and they voted against the troops.
Now if they couldn't stand up to the pressures that Howard Dean represented, how can we expect them to stand up to Al Qaida?
Senator Edwards, you have 90 seconds to respond.
Thank you.
One thing that's very clear is that a long resume does not equal good judgment.
I mean, we've seen over and over and over the misjudgments made by this administration.
I want to go back to what the vice president just said, because it's a continuation of the things he's been doing, unfortunately, on the campaign trail; it's a continuation of what he began his first answer with tonight.
John Kerry has voted for the biggest military appropriations bill in the country's history.
John Kerry has voted for the biggest intelligence appropriations in the country's history.
This vice president, when he was secretary of defense, cut over 80 weapons systems, including the very ones he's criticizing John Kerry for voting against.
These are weapons systems, a big chunk of which, the vice president himself suggested we get rid of after the Cold War.
The reality is that John Kerry has consistently supported the very men that he served with in Vietnam and led.
On the $87 billion, it was clear at the time of that vote that they had no plan to win the peace.
We're seeing the consequences of that everyday on the ground right now.
We stood up and said: For our troops, we must have a plan to win the peace.
We also thought it was wrong to have a $20 billion fund out of which $7.5 billion was going to go to a no-bid contract for Halliburton, the vice president's former company.
It was wrong then.
It's wrong now.
Mr. Vice President, you have 30 seconds.
Well, Gwen, I think the record speaks for itself.
These are two individuals who have been for the war when the headlines were good and against it when their poll ratings were bad.
We have not seen the kind of consistency that a commander in chief has to have in order to be a leader in wartime and in order to be able to see the strategy through to victory.
If we want to win the war on terror, it seems to me it's pretty clear the choice is George Bush, not John Kerry.
And 30 seconds...
John Kerry has been absolutely clear and consistent from the beginning that we must stay focused on the people who attacked us; that Saddam Hussein was a threat that needed to be addressed directly; that the weapons inspectors needed to have time to do their job.
Had they had time to do their job, they would have discovered what we now know, that in fact Saddam Hussein had no weapons, that in fact Saddam Hussein has no connection with 9/11, that in fact Saddam Hussein has little or no connection with Al Qaida.
Senator Edwards, new question to you, and you have two minutes to respond.
Part of what you have said and Senator Kerry has said that you are going to do in order to get us out of the problems in Iraq is to internationalize the effort.
Yet French and German officials have both said they have no intention even if John Kerry is elected of sending any troops into Iraq for any peacekeeping effort.
Does that make your effort or your plan to internationalize this effort seem kind of naive?
Well, let's start with what we know.
What we know is that the president and the vice president have not done the work to build the coalition that we need -- dramatically different than the first Gulf War.
We know that they haven't done it, and we know they can't do it.
They didn't, by the way, just reject the allies going into lead- up to the war.
They also rejected them in the effort to do the reconstruction in Iraq, and that has consequences.
What we believe is, as part of our entire plan for Iraq -- and we have a plan for Iraq.
They have a plan for Iraq too: more of the same.
We have a plan for success.
And that plan includes speeding up the training of the military.
We have less than half of the staff that we need there to complete that training.
Second, make sure that the reconstruction is sped up in a way that the Iraqis see some tangible benefit for what's happening.
And by the way, if we need to, we can take Iraqis out of Iraq to train them.
It is not secure enough.
It's so dangerous on the ground that they can't be trained there.
We can take them out of Iraq for purposes of training.
We should do whatever has to be done to train the Iraqis and to speed up that process.
That works in conjunction with making sure the elections take place on time.
Right now, the United Nations, which is responsible for the elections in January, has about 35 people there.
Now, that's compared with a much smaller country like East Timor, where they had over 200 people on the ground.
You need more than 35 people to hold an election in Cleveland, much less in Iraq.
And they keep saying the election's on schedule, this is going to happen.
The reality is we need a new president with credibility with the rest of the world and who has a real plan for success.
Success breeds contribution, breeds joining the coalition.
Not only that, I want to go back to what the vice president said.
He attacks us about the troops.
They sent 40,000 American troops into Iraq without the body armor they needed.
They sent them without the armored vehicles they needed.
While they were on the ground fighting, they lobbied the Congress to cut their combat pay.
This is the height of hypocrisy.
Mr. Vice President, you have 90 seconds.
Well, Gwen, it's hard to know where to start; there are so many inaccuracies there.
The fact of the matter is the troops wouldn't have what they have today if you guys had had your way.
You talk about internationalizing the effort.
They don't have a plan.
Basically, it's an echo.
You made the comment that the Gulf War coalition in '91 was far stronger than this.
No.
We had 34 countries then; we've got 30 today.
We've got troops beside us.
It's hard, after John Kerry referred to our allies as a coalition of the coerced and the bribed, to go out and persuade people to send troops and to participate in this process.
You end up with a situation in which -- talk about demeaning.
In effect, you demean the sacrifice of our allies when you say it's the wrong war, wrong place, wrong time, and oh, by the way, send troops.
Makes no sense at all.
It's totally inconsistent.
There isn't a plan there.
Our most important ally in the war on terror, in Iraq specifically, is Prime Minister Allawi.
He came recently and addressed a joint session of Congress that I presided over with the speaker of the House.
And John Kerry rushed out immediately after his speech was over with, where he came and he thanked America for our contributions and our sacrifice and pledged to hold those elections in January, went out and demeaned him, criticized him, challenged his credibility.
That is not the way to win friends and allies.
You're never going to add to the coalition with that kind of attitude.
Senator Edwards, 30 seconds.
Thank you.
The vice president suggests that we have the same number of countries involved now that we had in the first Gulf War.
The first Gulf War cost the American people $5 billion.
And regardless of what the vice president says, we're at $200 billion and counting.
Not only that, 90 percent of the coalition casualties, Mr. Vice President, the coalition casualties, are American casualties.
Ninety percent oIFILLf the cost of this effort are being borne by American taxpayers.
It is the direct result of the failures of this administration.
Mr. Vice President?
Classic example.
He won't count the sacrifice and the contribution of Iraqi allies.
It's their country.
They're in the fight.
They're increasingly the ones out there putting their necks on the line to take back their country from the terrorists and the old regime elements that are still left.
They're doing a superb job.
And for you to demean their sacrifices strikes me as...
Oh, I'm not...
... as beyond...
I'm not demeaning...
It is indeed.
You suggested...
No, sir, I did not...
... somehow they shouldn't count, because you want to be able to say that the Americans are taking 90 percent of the sacrifice.
You cannot succeed in this effort if you're not willing to recognize the enormous contribution the Iraqis are increasingly making to their own future.
We'll win when they take on responsibility for governance, which they're doing, and when the take on responsibility for their own security, which they increasingly are doing.
New question, similar topic, because I want to circle back to a question which I'm not quite certain we got an answer to.
But I will direct it to you first, Senator Edwards.
Thanks.
It's a question of American intelligence.
If this report that we've read about today is true, and if Vice President Cheney ordered it and asked about this, do you think that, in the future, that your administration or the Bush administration would have sufficient and accurate enough intelligence to be able to make decisions about where to go next?
Well, let me speak, first of all, to what the vice president just said, and then I'll answer that question.
This, unfortunately -- what the vice president is telling people is inconsistent with everything they see every single day.
It's a continuation of, "Well, there's a strong connection between Al Qaida and Saddam Hussein."
It's not true.
It's a continuation of at least insinuating that there's some connection between 9/11 and Saddam Hussein.
It's not true.
It's saying to the American people, as the president said last Thursday, and the vice president continues to say tonight, that things are going well in Iraq, contrary to what people who have been there have seen, including Republican leaders, contrary to what everyone in America sees on their television every day -- Americans being kidnapped, people being beheaded, parts of the country under the control of insurgents, even today, under the control of the insurgents.
The vice president has still not said anything about what Mr. Bremer said, about the failure to have adequate troops, the failure to be able to secure the country in the short term.
You know, remember "shock and awe"?
Look at where we are now.
It is a direct result of the failure to plan, the failure to have others involved in this effort.
This is not an accident.
Now, let me go back to your question.
If we want to do the things that need to be done to keep this country safe, we can't be dragged kicking and screaming to it.
One thing that everybody does agree on is that 9/11 did change things.
But what's happened is this administration opposed the creation of a 9/11 Commission to find out why it happened and what we needed to do.
They opposed the creation of a Department of Homeland Security, and then they were for it.
We can't react that way.
We must be more aggressive.
With John Kerry as president of the United States, we are committed to immediately implementing all of the reforms suggested by the 9/11 Commission, so that we have the information we need to find terrorists and crush them before they hurt us.
Mr. Vice President?
Gwen, the story that appeared today about this report is one I asked for.
I ask an awful lot of questions as part of my job as vice president.
A CIA spokesman was quoted in that story as saying they had not yet reached the bottom line and there is still debate over this question of the relationship between Zarqawi and Saddam Hussein.
The report also points out that at one point some of Zarqawi's people were arrested.
Saddam personally intervened to have them released, supposedly at the request of Zarqawi  But let's look at what we know about Mr. Zarqawi.
We know he was running a terrorist camp, training terrorists in Afghanistan prior to 9/11.
We know that when we went into Afghanistan that he then migrated to Baghdad.
He set up shop in Baghdad, where he oversaw the poisons facility up at Khurmal (ph), where the terrorists were developing ricin and other deadly substances to use.
We know he's still in Baghdad today.
He is responsible for most of the major car bombings that have killed or maimed thousands of people.
He's the one you will see on the evening news beheading hostages.
He is, without question, a bad guy.
He is, without question, a terrorist.
He was, in fact, in Baghdad before the war, and he's in Baghdad now after the war.
The fact of the matter is that this is exactly the kind of track record we've seen over the years.
We have to deal with Zarqawi by taking him out, and that's exactly what we'll do.
Mr. Vice President, in June of 2000 when you were still CEO of Halliburton, you said that US.
businesses should be allowed to do business with Iran because, quote, "Unilateral sanctions almost never work."
After four years as vice president now, and with Iran having been declared by your administration as part of the "Axis of Evil," do you still believe that we should lift sanctions on Iran?
No, I do not.
And, Gwen, at the time, I was talking specifically about this question of unilateral sanctions.
What happens when we impose unilateral sanctions is, unless there's a collective effort, then other people move in and take advantage of the situation and you don't have any impact, except to penalize American companies.
We've got sanctions on Iran now.
We may well want to go to the U.N. Security Council and ask for even tougher sanctions if they don't live up to their obligations under the initial -- International Atomic Energy Agency Non-Proliferation Treaty.
We dealt with Iran differently than we have Iraq partly because Iran has not yet, as Iraq did, violated 12 years of resolutions by the U.N. Security Council.
We're working with the Brits and the Germans and the French, who've been negotiating with the Iranians.
We recently were actively involved in a meeting with the board of governors in the International Atomic Energy Agency.
And as I say, there will be a follow-up meeting in November to determine whether or not Iran's living up to their commitments and obligations.
And if they aren't, my guess is then the board of governors will recommend sending the whole matter to the U.N. Security Council for the application of the international sanctions, which I think would be exactly the right way to go.
We're addressing North Korea on a similar basis, working with the Chinese, the South Koreans, the Japanese and others to try to bring them around.
One of the great by-products, for example, of what we did in Iraq and Afghanistan is that five days after we captured Saddam Hussein, Moammar Gadhafi in Libya came forward and announced that he was going to surrender all of his nuclear materials to the United States, which he has done.
This was one of the biggest sources of proliferation in the world today in terms of the threat that was represented by that.
The suppliers network that provided that, headed by Mr. A.Q.
Khan, has been shut down.
We've made major progress in dealing here with a major issue with respect to nuclear proliferation.
And we'll continue to press very hard on the North Koreans and the Iranians as well.
Senator Edwards?
Well, the vice president talks about there being a member, or someone associated with Al Qaida, in Iraq.
There are 60 countries who have members of Al Qaida in them.
How many of those countries are we going to invade?
Not only that, he talks about Iran.
The reality about Iran is that Iran has moved forward with their nuclear weapons program on their watch.
They ceded responsibility to dealing with it to the Europeans.
Now, the vice president, as you pointed out, spoke out loudly for lifting the sanctions on Iraq.
John Kerry and I believe we need to strengthen the sanctions on Iraq, including closing the loophole that allows companies to use a subsidiary, offshore subsidiaries to do business with Iran.
I mentioned Halliburton a few minute ago in connection with the $87 billion, and you raised it in this question.
This is relevant, because he was pushing for lifting sanctions when he was CEO of Halliburton.
Here's why we didn't think Halliburton should have a no-bid contract.
While he was CEO of Halliburton, they paid millions of dollars in fines for providing false information on their company, just like Enron and Ken Lay.
They did business with Libya and Iran, two sworn enemies of the United States.
They're now under investigation for having bribed foreign officials during that period of time.
Not only that, they've gotten a $7.5 billion no-bid contract in Iraq, and instead of part of their money being withheld, which is the way it's normally done, because they're under investigation, they've continued to get their money.
Mr. Vice President?
I can respond, Gwen, but it's going to take more than 30 seconds.
Well, that's all you've got.
Well, the reason they keep mentioning Halliburton is because they're trying to throw up a smokescreen.
They know the charges are false.
They know that if you go, for example, to factcheck.com (sic), an independent Web site sponsored by the University of Pennsylvania, you can get the specific details with respect to Halliburton.
It's an effort that they've made repeatedly to try to confuse the voters and to raise questions, but there's no substance to the charges.
Thirty seconds.
These are the facts.
The facts are the vice president's company that he was CEO of, that did business with sworn enemies of the United States, paid millions of dollars in fines for providing false financial information, is under investigation for bribing foreign officials.
The same company that got a $7.5 billion no-bid contract, the rule is that part of their money is supposed to be withheld when they're under investigation, as they are now, for having overcharged the American taxpayer,
