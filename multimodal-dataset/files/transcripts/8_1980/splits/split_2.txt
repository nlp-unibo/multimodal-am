talked about.
But I think, by improving productivity, they would be far less inflationary than the consumption-oriented tax cut that Governor Reagan is recommending.
Ms. Quinn.
Mr. Anderson, I'll call you for that forecast.
Mr. Reagan, will you publish specific forecasts within two weeks, so that the voters can have time to analyze and absorb them before the election, showing exactly what all these things you've discussed tonight - for energy, cities and defense - mean for inflation over the next five years?
Miss Quinn, I don't have to.
I've done it.
We have a back-up paper to my economic speech of a couple of weeks ago in Chicago, that gives all of the figures.
And we used - yes, we used - the Senate Budget Committee's projections for five years, which are based on an average inflation rate of 7.5% - which, I think, that under our plan, can be eliminated.
And eliminated probably more quickly than our plan, but we wanted to be so conservative with it, that people would see how.
how well it could be done.
Now, John's been in the Congress for 20 years.
And John tells us that first, we've got to reduce spending before we can reduce taxes.
Well, if you've got a kid that's extravagant, you can lecture him all you want to about his extravagance.
Or you can cut his allowance and achieve the same end much quicker.
But Government has never reduced Government does not tax to get the money it needs.
Government always needs the money it gets.
And when John talks about his non-inflationary plan, as far as I have been able to learn, there are 88 proposals in it that call for additional Government spending programs.
Now, I speak with some confidence of our plan, because I took over a state - California - 10% of the population of this nation - a state that, if it were a nation, would be the seventh-ranking economic power in the world.
And that state we controlled spending.
We cut the rate of increase in spending in half.
But at the same time, we gave back to the people of California - in tax rebates, tax credits, tax cuts - $5.7 billion.
I vetoed 993 measures without having a veto overturned.
And among those vetoes, I stopped $16 billion in additional spending.
And the funny thing was that California, which is normally above the national average in inflation and unemployment, for those six years for the first time, was below the national average in both inflation and unemployment.
We have considered inflation in our figures.
We deliberately took figures that we, ourselves, believed were too conservative.
I believe the budget can be balanced by 1982 or 1983, and it is a combination of planned reduction of the tax increase that Carter has built into the economy, and that's what he's counting on for his plan.
But he's going to get a half-a-trillion dollars more over the next five years that he can use for additional programs, or hopefully, someplace down the line, balancing the budget.
We believe that that's too much additional money to take out of the pockets of the people.
Mr. Anderson.
Mr. Moyers, I'm not here to debate Governor Reagan's record as Governor.
This is 1980 and not 1966.
But I do know that, despite his pledge to reduce state Government spending, that it rose from $4.6 billion when he took office in 1967, to $10.2 billion during his eight years in office.
Spending, in other words.
more than doubled, and it rose at a faster rate than spending was rising in the Federal Government.
But on his very optimistic figures about his tax cut producing a balanced budget by 1983, and the fact that he is using, he says, the figures of the Senate Budget Committee, that Senate Budget Committee Report does not accommodate all of the Reagan defense plans.
It doesn't accommodate the expenditures that he calls for, for accelerated development and deployment of a new manned strategic bomber, for a permanent fleet in the Indian Ocean, for the restoration of the fleet to 600 ships, to the development and deployment of a dedicated modern aircraft interceptor.
In other words, I have seen his program costed out to the point where it would amount to more than $300 million a year, just for the military.
And I think the figures that he has given are simply not going to stand up.
Would would you have a comment, Mr. Reagan?
Well, some people look up figures, and some people make up figures.
And John has just made up some very interesting figures.
We took the Senate report, of course.
But we did factor in our own ideas with regard to increases in the projected military spending that we believe would, over a period of time, do what is necessary.
Now also, with regard to the figures about California.
The truth of the matter is, we did cut the increase in spending in half.
It at the John doesn't quite realize - he's never held an executive position of that kind.
And I think being Governor of California is probably the closest thing to the Presidency, if that's possible, of any executive job in America today - because it is the most populous state.
And I can only tell him that we reduced, in proportion of other states, the per capita spending, the per capita size of Government - we only increased the size of Government one-twelfth what it had increased in the preceding eight years.
And one journal, the San Francisco Chronicle, a respected newspaper, said there was no question about the fact that Governor Reagan had prevented the State of California from going bankrupt.
Our final question comes from Soma Golden, and it's directed to Mr. Reagan.
I'd like to switch the focus from inflation to God.
This week, Cardinal Medeiros of Boston warned Catholics that it's sinful to vote for candidates who favor abortion.
This did not defeat the two men he opposed, but it did raise questions about the roles of church and state.
You.
Mr. Reagan, have endorsed the participation of fundamentalist churches in your campaign.
And you, Mr. Anderson, have tried three times to amend the Constitution to recognize the, quote, "law and authority," unquote, of Jesus Christ.
My question: Do you approve of the Church's actions this week in Boston?
And should a President be guided by organized religion on issues like abortion, equal rights, and defense spending?
Mr. Reagan.
Mr. Reagan.
Oh, I'm it's my question.
But whether I agree or disagree with some individual, or what he may say, or how he may say it, I don't think there's any way that we can suggest that because people believe in God and go to church, that they should not want reflected in those people and those causes they support, their own belief in morality, and in the high traditions and principles which we've abandoned so much in this country.
Going around this country, I think that I have found a great hunger in America for a spiritual revival.
For a belief that law must be based on a higher law.
For a return to traditions and values that we once had.
Our Government, in its most sacred documents - the Constitution and the Declaration of Independence and all - speak of man being created, of a Creator.
That we're a nation under God.
Now, I have thought for a long time that too many of our churches have been too reluctant to speak up in behalf of what they believe is proper in Government, and they have been too too lax in interfering, in recent years, with Government's invasion of the family itself, putting itself between parent and child.
I vetoed a number of bills of that kind myself, when I was in California.
Now, whether it is rightful, on a single issue, for anyone to advocate that someone should not be elected or not, I won't take a position on that.
But I do believe that no one in this country should be denied the right to express themselves, or to even try to persuade others to follow their leader.
That's what elections are all about.
Ms. Golden.
Okay.
I would point out that churches are tax-exempt institutions, and I'll repeat my question.
Do you approve the Church's action this week in Boston, and should a President be guided by organized religion on issues like abortion, equal rights and defense spending?
Ms. Golden, certainly the church has the right to take a position on moral issues.
But to try, as occurred in the case that you mentioned - that specific case - to try to tell the parishioners of any church, of any denomination, how they should vote, or for whom they should vote, I think violates the principle of separation of church and state.
Now, Governor Reagan is running on a platform that calls for a Constitutional amendment banning abortion.
I think that is a moral issue that ought to be left to the freedom of conscience of the individual.
And for the state to interfere with a Constitutional amendment, and tell a woman that she must carry that pregnancy to term, regardless of her personal belief, that, I think, violates freedom of conscience as much as anything that I can think of.
And he is also running on a platform that suggests a litmus test for the selection of judges - that only judges that hold a certain, quote, "view," on the sanctity of family life, ought to be appointed to the Federal Judiciary, one of the three great independent branches of our Government.
No.
I believe in freedom of choice.
I don't believe in Constitutional Amendments that would interfere with that.
I don't believe in trying to legislate new tests for the selection of the Federal Judiciary.
On the Amendment that you mentioned, I abandoned it 15 years ago.
And I have said freely, all over this country, that it was a mistake for me or anyone to ever try to put the Judeo-Christian heritage of this country, important as it is, and important as my religious faith is to me - it's a very deeply personal matter.
But for me to try, in this very pluralistic society of ours, to try to frame any definition, whatever, of what that belief should be, is wrong.
And so, not once, but twice - in 1971 - I voted on the floor of the House of Representatives against a Constitutional amendment that tried to bring prayer back into the public schools.
I think mother ought to whisper to Johnny and to Susie, as they button their coats in the morning and leave for the classroom, "Be sure to say a prayer before you start your day's work."
But I don't think that the state, the Board of Regents, a Board of Education, or any state official, should try to compose that prayer for a child to recite.
Mr. Reagan.
The litmus test that John says is in the Republican platform, says no more than the judges to be appointed should have a respect for innocent life.
Now, I don't think that's a bad idea.
I think all of us should have a respect for innocent life.
With regard to the freedom of the individual for choice with regard to abortion, there's one individual who's not being considered at all.
That's the one who is being aborted.
And I've noticed that everybody that is for abortion has already been born.
I I think that, technically, I know this is a difficult and an emotional problem, and many people sincerely feel on both sides of this, but I do believe that maybe we could find the answer through medical evidence, if we would determine once and for all, is an unborn child a human being?
I happen to believe it is.
Mr. Anderson.
I also think that that unborn child has a right to be wanted.
And I also believe, sir, that the most personal intimate decision that any woman is ever called upon to make is the decision as to whether or not she shall carry a pregnancy to term.
And for the state to interfere in that decision, under whatever guise, and with whatever rationale, for the state to try to take over in that situation, and by edict, command what the individual shall do, and substitute itself for that individual's conscience, for her right to consult her rabbi, her minister, her priest, her doctor - any other counselor of her choice - I think goes beyond what we want to ever see accomplished in this country, if we really believe in the First Amendment: if we really believe in freedom of choice and the right of the individual.
Mr. Reagan you now have three minutes for closing remarks.
Before beginning my closing remarks, here, I would just like to remark a concern that I have that we have criticized the failures of the Carter policy here rather considerably, both of us this evening.
And there might be some feeling of unfairness about this because he was not here to respond.
But I believe it would have been much more unfair to have had John Anderson denied the right to participate in this debate.
And I want to express my appreciation to the League of Women Voters for adopting a course with which I believe the great majority of Americans are in agreement.
Now, as to my closing remarks: I've always believed that this land was placed here between the two great oceans by some divine plan.
That it was placed here to be found by a special kind of people - people who had a special love for freedom and who had the courage to uproot themselves and leave hearth and homeland, and came to what, in the beginning, was the most undeveloped wilderness possible.
We came from 100 different corners of the earth.
We spoke a multitude of tongues.
We landed on this Eastern shore and then went out over the mountains and the prairies and the deserts and the far western mountains to the Pacific, building cities and towns and farms, and schools and churches.
If wind, water or fire destroyed them, we built them again.
And in so doing, at the same time, we built a new breed of human called an American - a proud, an independent., and a most compassionate individual, for the most part.
Two hundred years ago, Tom Paine, when the 13 tiny colonies were trying to become a nation, said, we have it in our power to begin the world over again.
Today.
we're confronted with the horrendous problems that we've discussed here tonight.
And some people in high positions of leadership, tell us that the answer is to retreat.
That the best is over.
That we must cut back.
That we must share in an ever-increasing scarcity.
That we must, in the failure to be able to protect our national security as it is today, we must not be provocative to any possible adversary.
Well, we, the living Americans, have gone through four wars.
We've gone through a Great Depression in our lifetime that literally was worldwide and almost brought us to our knees.
But we came through all of those things and we achieved even new heights and new greatness.
The living Americans today have fought harder, paid a higher price for freedom, and done more to advance the dignity of man than any people who ever lived on this earth.
For 200 years, we've lived in the future, believing that tomorrow would be better than today, and today would be better than yesterday.
I still believe that.
I'm not running for the Presidency because I believe that I can solve the problems we've discussed tonight.
I believe the people of this country can, and together, we can begin the world over again.
We can meet our destiny - and that destiny to build a land here that will be, for all mankind, a shining city on a hill.
I think we ought to get at it.
Mr. Anderson, you have the final three minutes.
Mr. Movers, President Carter was not right a few weeks ago when he said that the American people were confronted with only two choices, with only two men, and with only two parties.
I think you've seen tonight in this debate that Governor Reagan and I have agreed on exactly one thing - we are both against the reimposition of a peacetime draft.
We have disagreed, I believe, on virtually every other issue.
I respect him for showing tonight - for appearing here, and I thank the League of Women Voters for the opportunity that they have given me.
I am running for President as an Independent because I believe our country is in trouble.
I believe that all of us are going to have to begin to work together to solve our problems.
If you think that I am a spoiler, consider these facts: Do you really think that our economy is healthy?
Do you really think that 8 million Americans being out of work and the 50% unemployment among the youth of our country are acceptable?
Do you really think that our armed forces are really acceptably strong in those areas of conventional capability where they should be?
Do you think that our political institutions are working the way they should when literally only half of our citizens vote?
I don't think you do think that.
And therefore, I think you ought to consider doing something about it, and voting for an Independent in 1980.
You know, a generation of office seekers has tried to tell the American people that they could get something for nothing.
It's been a time, therefore, of illusion and false hopes, and the longer it continues, the more dangerous it becomes.
We've got to stop drifting.
What I wish tonight so desperately is that we had had more time to talk about some of the other issues that are so fundamentally important.
A great historian, Henry Steele Commager, said that in their lust for victory, neither traditional party is looking beyond November.
And he went on to cite three issues that their platforms totally ignore: atomic warfare, Presidential Directive 59 notwithstanding.
If we don't resolve that issue, all others become irrelevant.
The issue of our natural resources; the right of posterity to inherit the earth, and what kind of earth will it be?
The issue of nationalism - the recognition, he says, that every major problem confronting us is global, and cannot be solved by nationalism here or elsewhere - that is chauvinistic, that is parochial, that is as anachronistic as states' rights was in the days of Jefferson Davis.
Those are some of the great issues - atomic warfare, the use of our natural resources, and the issue of nationalism - that I intend to be talking about in the remaining six weeks of this campaign, and I dare hope that the American people will be listening and that they will see that an Independent government of John Anderson and Patrick Lucey can give us the kind of coalition government that we need in 1980 to begin to solve our problems.
Thank you.
