evidently 99 senators -- I think it was 99 senators supported that position.
Global warming, the Senate did turn it down.
I think --
99 to nothing.
Well, that vote wasn't exactly -- a lot of the supporters of the Kyoto Treaty actually ended up voting for that because the way it was worded.
But there's no doubt there's a lot of opposition to it in the Senate.
I'm not for command and control techniques either.
I'm for working with the groups, not just with industry but also with the citizen groups and local communities to control sprawl in ways that the local communities themselves come up with.
But I disagree that we don't know the cause of global warming.
I think that we do.
It's pollution, carbon dioxide, and other chemicals that are even more potent, but in smaller quantities, that cause this.
Look, the world's temperature is going up, weather patterns are changing, storms are getting more violent and unpredictable.
What are we going to tell our children?
I'm a grandfather now.
I want to be able to tell my grandson when I'm in my later years that I didn't turn away from the evidence that showed that we were doing some serious harm.
In my faith tradition, it is -- it's written in the book of Matthew, "Where your heart is, there is your treasure also."
And I believe that -- that we ought to recognize the value to our children and grandchildren of taking steps that preserve the environment in a way that's good for them.
Yeah, I agree.
I just -- I think there has been -- some of the scientists, I believe, Mr. Vice President, haven't they been changing their opinion a little bit on global warming?
A profound scientist recently made a different --
Both of you have now violated -- excuse me.
Both of you have now violated your own rules.
Hold that thought.
I've been trying so hard not to.
I know, I know.
But under your alls rules you are not allowed to ask each other a question.
I let you do it a moment ago.
Twice.
Now you just -- twice, sorry.
(LAUGHTER)
That's an interruption, by the way.
That's an interruption, okay.
But anyhow, you just did it so now --
I'm sorry.
I apologize, Mr. Vice President.
You aren't allowed to do that either, see?
(LAUGHTER) I'm sorry, go ahead and finish your thought.
People care about these things I've found out.
Of course they care about them.
Oh, you mean the rules.
Yeah, right, exactly right.
Go ahead.
What the heck.
I -- of course there's a lot -- look, global warming needs to be taken very seriously, and I take it seriously.
But science, there's a lot -- there's differing opinions.
And before we react, I think it's best to have the full accounting, full understanding of what's taking place.
And I think to answer your question, I think both of us care a lot about the environment.
We may have different approaches.
We may have different approaches in terms of how we deal with local folks.
I just cited an example of the administration just unilaterally acting without any input.
And I remember you gave a very good answer to New Hampshire about the White Mountains, about how it was important to keep that collaborative effort in place.
I feel very strongly the same place.
It certainly wasn't the attitude that took place out west, however.
New question.
Last question.
For you, Governor.
And this flows somewhat out of the Boston debate.
You, your running mate, your campaign officials have charged that Vice President Gore exaggerates, embellishes and stretches the facts, etcetera.
Are you -- do you believe these are serious issues?
This is a serious issue that the voters should use in deciding which one of you two men to vote for on November 7?
Well, we all make mistakes.
I've been known to mangle a syl-a-ble or two myself, you know, if you know what I mean.
I think credibility is important.
It is going to be important for the president to be credible with Congress, important for the president to be credible with foreign nations.
And yes, I think it's something that people need to consider.
This isn't something new.
I read a report, or a memo, from somebody in his 1988 campaign -- I forgot the fellow's name -- warning then Senator Gore to be careful about exaggerating claims.
I thought during his debate with Senator Bradley saying he authored the EITC when it didn't happen.
I mention the last debate --
EITC?
The Earned Income Tax Credit, sorry.
That's all right.
A lot of initials from a guy who's not from Washington, isn't it?
Anyway, he co-sponsored McCain-Feingold, and yet he didn't.
And so I think this is an issue.
I found it to be an issue in trying to defend my tax relief package.
I thought there was some exaggerations about the numbers.
But the people are going to have to make up their mind on this issue.
And I am going to continue to defend my record and defend my propositions against what I think are exaggerations.
Exaggerations like, for example, only 5% of seniors receive benefits under my Medicare reform package.
That's what he said the other day, and that's simply not the case.
And I have every right in the world to defend my record and positions.
That's what debates are about and that's what campaigns are about.
Vice President Gore?
I got some of the details wrong last week in some of the examples that I used, Jim, and I'm sorry about that.
And I'm going to try to do better.
One of the reasons I regret it is that getting a detail wrong interfered several times with the point that I was trying to make.
However many days that young girl in Florida stood in her classroom, however long, even if it was only one day, doesn't change the fact that there are a lot of overcrowded classrooms in America and we need to do something about that.
There are seniors who pay more for their prescriptions than a lot of other people, more than their pets, sometimes.
More sometimes than people in foreign countries.
And we need to do something about that.
Not with the measure that leaves the majority of them without any real basic help until the next president's term of four years is over.
But right away.
And that means doing it under the Medicare program.
I can't promise that I will never get another detail wrong.
I can promise you that I will try not to, and hard.
But I will promise you this with all the confidence in my heart and in the world, that I will do my best if I'm elected president, I'll work my heart out to get the big things right for the American people.
Does that resolve the issue, Governor?
That's going to be up to the people, isn't it?
Does it resolve it for you?
Depends on what he says in the future in the campaign.
Your folks are saying some awful things.
I hope they're not awful things.
I think they may be using the man's own words.
Well, what I mean is calling him a serial exaggerator --
I don't believe I've used those words.
No, but your campaign ads.
Maybe they have.
And your campaign officials have.
And your campaign officials, Mr. Vice President, are now calling the governor a bumbler.
Wait a minute.
(LAUGHTER)
I mean, my point is, should this -- is this --
I don't use language like that and I don't think that we should.
It's in your commercial.
I understand.
The -- I haven't seen that, in my commercials?
You haven't seen the commercial?
Your --
I think that what -- I think the point of that is that anybody would have a hard time trying to make a tax cut plan that is so large, that would put us into such big deficits, that gives almost half the benefits to the wealthiest of the wealthy.
I think anybody would have a hard time explaining that clearly in a way that makes sense to the average person.
That's the kind of exaggeration I was just talking about.
(LAUGHTER)
Well, I wasn't the one having trouble explaining it.
Gentlemen, it's time to go to the closing statements.
And Vice President Gore, you have two minutes.
Jim, one of the issues that I would like to close with in my statement is education, because it's an example of the overall approach that I think is important.
This race is about values, it's about change, it's about giving choices to the American people.
And education is my number one priority, because I think that it's the most important big major change that we can bring in our country.
I agree with Governor Bush that we should have new accountability, testing of students.
I think that we should require states to test all students, test schools and school districts, and I think that we should go further and require teacher testing for new teachers also.
The difference is that while my plan starts with new accountability and maintains local control, it doesn't stop there.
Because I want to give new choices to parents.
To send their kids to college with a $10,000 tax deduction for college tuition per child per year.
I want to reduce the size of the classrooms in this country.
For one basic reason, so that students can get more one-on-one time with teachers.
And the way to do that is first to recruit more teachers.
I've a plan in my budget to recruit 100,000 new, highly qualified teachers and to help local school districts build new schools.
I think that we have to put more emphasis on early learning and pre-school.
Now, here is how that connects with all the rest of what we've been talking about.
If you have -- if you squander the surplus on a huge tax cut that goes mostly to those at the top, then you can't make education the top priority.
If the tax cut is your number one, two, three and four priority, you can't do education.
You can't do both.
You have to choose.
I choose education and health care, the environment and retirement security, and I ask for your support.
Governor Bush, two minutes.
Jim, thank you very much.
Mr. Vice President, thank you very much, and I would like to thank the folks here at Wake Forest, and I want to thank you all for listening.
I'm running to get some things done for America.
There's too many issues left unresolved.
There's been too much finger pointing and too much name calling in Washington, D.C.
I would like to unite this country to get an agenda done that will speak to the hopes and aspirations of the future.
I want to have an education system that sets high standards, local control of schools and strong accountability.
No child should be left behind in America.
I want to make sure we rebuild our military to keep the peace.
I worry about morale in today's military.
The warning signs are clear.
It is time to have a new commander in chief who will rebuild the military, pay our men and women more, make sure they're housed better and have a focused mission for our military.
Once and for all, I want to do something about Medicare.
This issue has been too long on the table because it's been a political issue.
It's time to bring folks together to say that all seniors will get prescription drug coverage.
I want to do something about Social Security.
It's an important priority, because now is the time to act and we're going to say to our seniors, our promises we've made to you will be promises kept.
But younger workers, in order to make sure the system exists tomorrow, younger workers ought to be able to take some of your own money and invest it in safe securities to get a better rate of return on that money.
And finally, I do believe in tax relief.
I believe we can set our priorities.
I don't believe, like the vice president does, in huge government.
I believe in limited government.
By having a limited government and a focused government, we can send some of the money back to the people who pay the bills.
I want to have tax relief for all people who pay the bills in America, because I think you can spend your money more wisely than the federal government can.
Thank you for listening.
I'm asking for your vote, and God bless.
