question his legitimacy, and he's still going to try to be actively involved.
He is an indicted war criminal.
He should be held accountable.
Now, I did want to pick up on one of the statements earlier, and maybe I have heard, maybe I have heard the previous statements wrong, Governor.
In some of the discussions we've had about when it's appropriate for the U.S. to use force around the world, at times the standards that you've laid down have given me the impression that if it's something like a genocide taking place or what they called ethnic cleansing in Bosnia, that that alone would not be, that that wouldn't be the kind of situation that would cause you to think that the U.S. ought to get involved with troops.
Now, have to be other factors involved for me to want to be involved.
But by itself, that to me can bring into play a fundamental American strategic interest because I think it's based on our values.
Now, have I got that wrong?
Trying to figure out who the questioner was.
If I think it's in our nation's strategic interest I'll commit troops.
I thought it was in our strategic interests to keep Milosevic in check because of our relations in NATO, and that's why I took the position I took.
I think it's important for NATO to be strong and confident.
I felt like unchecked Milosevic would harm NATO, and so it depends on the situation, Mr. Vice President.
Well, let's stay on the subject for a moment.
New question related to this.
I figured this out; in the last 20 years there have been eight major actions that involved the introduction of U.S. ground, air or naval forces.
Let me name them.
Lebanon, Grenada, Panama, the Persian Gulf, Somalia, Bosnia, Haiti, Kosovo.
If you had been president for any of those interventions, would any of those interventions not have happened?
Can you run through the list again?
Sure.
Lebanon.
I thought that was a mistake.
Grenada.
I supported that.
Panama.
I supported that.
Persian Gulf.
Yes, I voted for it, supported it.
Somalia.
Of course, and that again -- no, I think that that was ill-considered.
I did support it at the time.
It was in the previous administration, in the Bush-Quayle administration, and I think in retrospect the lessons there are ones that we should take very, very seriously.
Bosnia.
Oh, yes.
Haiti.
Yes.
And then Kosovo.
Yes.
We talked about that.
Want me to do it with you?
Lebanon.
Make a couple comments.
Sure, absolutely, sure.
Somalia.
Started off as a humanitarian mission and it changed into a nation-building mission, and that's where the mission went wrong.
The mission was changed.
And as a result, our nation paid a price.
And so I don't think our troops ought to be used for what's called nation-building.
I think our troops ought to be used to fight and win war.
I think our troops ought to be used to help overthrow the dictator when it's in our best interests.
But in this case it was a nation-building exercise, and same with Haiti.
I wouldn't have supported either.
What about Lebanon?
Yes.
Grenada.
Yes.
Panama?
Yes.
Some of them I've got a conflict of interest on, if you know what I mean.
I do, I do.
The Persian Gulf, obviously.
And Bosnia.
And you have already talked about Kosovo.
But the reverse side of the question, Governor, that Vice President Gore mentioned, 600,000 people died in Rwanda in 1994.
There was no U.S. intervention, no intervention from the outside world.
Was that a mistake not to intervene?
I think the administration did the right thing in that case.
I do.
It was a horrible situation, no one liked to see it on our TV screens, but it's a case where we need to make sure we have an early warning system in place in places where there could be ethnic cleansing and genocide the way we saw it there in Rwanda.
And that's a case where we need to use our influence to have countries in Africa come together and help deal with the situation.
The administration, seems like we're having a great love fest tonight, but the administration made the right decision on training Nigerian troops for situations just such as this in Rwanda, and so I thought they made the right decision not to send U.S. troops into Rwanda.
Do you have any second thoughts on that, based on what you said a moment ago about genocide?
I'd like to come back to the question of nation building, but let me address the question directly, first.
Fine.
We did, actually, send troops into Rwanda to help with the humanitarian relief measures.
My wife Tipper, who is here, actually went on a military plane with General Sholicatchvieli on one of those flights.
But I think in retrospect we were too late getting in there.
We could have saved more lives if we had acted earlier.
But I do not think that it was an example of a conflict where we should have put our troops in to try to separate the parties for this reason, Jim.
One of the criteria that I think is important in deciding when and if we should ever get involved around the world is whether or not our national security interest is involved, if we can really make the difference with military forces.
If we tried everything else, if we have allies.
In the Balkans we have allies, NATO, ready, willing and able to go and carry a big part of the burden.
In Africa we did not.
Now, we have tried -- our country has tried to create an Africa crisis response team there, and we've met some resistance.
We have had some luck with Nigeria, but in Sierra Leon, and now that Nigeria has become a democracy, and we hope it stays that way, then maybe we can build on that.
But because we had no allies and because it was very unclear that we could actually accomplish what we would want to accomplish about putting military forces there, I think it was the right thing not to jump in, as heartbreaking as it was, but I think we should have come in much quicker with the humanitarian mission.
So what would you say, Governor, that somebody would say hey wait a minute, why not Africa, I mean why the Middle East, why the Balkans, but not Africa, when 600,000 people's lives are at risk?
Well, I understand, and Africa is important.
And we've got to do a lot of work in Africa to promote democracy and trade, and there are some -- Vice President mentioned Nigeria is a fledgling democracy.
We have to work with Nigeria.
Itâ€™s an important continent.
But there's got to be priorities, and Middle East is a priority for a lot of reasons, as is Europe and the Far East, our own hemisphere.
And those are my four top priorities should I be the president, not to say we won't be engaged nor work hard to get other nations to come together to prevent atrocity.
I thought the best example of a way to handle the situation was East Timor when we provided logistical support to the Australians, support that only we can provide.
I thought that was a good model.
But we can't be all things to all people in the world, Jim.
And I think that's where maybe the vice president and I begin to have some differences.
I'm worried about overcommitting our military around the world.
I want to be judicious in its use.
You mentioned Haiti.
I wouldn't have sent troops to Haiti.
I didn't think it was a mission worthwhile.
It was a nation building mission, and it was not very successful.
It cost us billions, a couple billions of dollars, and I'm not so sure democracy is any better off in Haiti than it was before.
Vice President Gore, do you agree with the governor's views on nation building, the use of military, our military, for nation building as he described and defined it?
I don't think we agree on that.
I would certainly also be judicious in evaluating any potential use of American troops overseas.
I think we have to be very reticent about that.
But look, Jim, the world is changing so rapidly.
The way I see it, the world is getting much closer together.
Like it or not, we are now -- the United States is now the natural leader of the world.
All these other countries are looking to us.
Now, just because we cannot be involved everywhere, and shouldn't be, doesn't mean that we should shy away from going in anywhere.
Now, both of us are kind of, I guess, stating the other's position in a maximalist extreme way, but I think there is a difference here.
This idea of nation building is kind of a pejorative phrase, but think about the great conflict of the past century, World War II.
During the years between World War I and World War II, a great lesson was learned by our military leaders and the people of the United States.
The lesson was that in the aftermath of World War I, we kind of turned our backs and left them to their own devices and they brewed up a lot of trouble that quickly became World War II.
And acting upon that lesson in the aftermath of our great victory in World War II, we laid down the Marshall Plan, President Truman did.
We got intimately involved in building NATO and other structures there.
We still have lots of troops in Europe.
And what did we do in the late '40's and '50's and '60's?
We were nation building.
And it was economic.
But it was also military.
And the confidence that those countries recovering from the wounds of war had by having troops there.
We had civil administrators come in to set up their ways of building their towns back.
You said in the Boston debate, Governor, on this issue of nation building, that the United States military is overextended now.
Where is it overextended?
Where are there U.S. military that you would bring home if you become president?
First let me just say one comment about what the vice president said.
I think one of the lessons in between World War I and World War II is we let our military atrophy.
And we can't do that.
We've got to rebuild our military.
But one of the problems we have in the military is we're in a lot of places around the world.
And I mentioned one, and that's the Balkans.
I would very much like to get our troops out of there.
I recognize we can't do it now, nor do I advocate an immediate withdrawal.
That would be an abrogation of our agreement with NATO.
No one is suggesting that.
But I think it ought to be one of our priorities to work with our European friends to convince them to put troops on the ground.
And there is an example.
Haiti is another example.
Now there are some places where I think -- you know, I've supported the administration in Columbia.
I think it's important for us to be training Columbians in that part of the world.
The hemisphere is in our interest to have a peaceful Columbia.
But --
The use of the military, there -- some people are now suggesting that if you don't want to use the military to maintain the peace, to do the civil thing, is it time to consider a civil force of some kind that comes in after the military that builds nations or all of that?
Is that on your radar screen?
I don't think so.
I think what we need to do is convince people who live in the lands they live in to build the nations.
Maybe I'm missing something here.
I mean, we're going to have kind of a nation building core from America?
Absolutely not.
Our military is meant to fight and win war.
That's what it's meant to do.
And when it gets overextended, morale drops.
I strongly believe we need to have a military presence in the Korean peninsula, not only to keep the peace in the peninsula, but to keep regional stability.
And I strongly believe we need to keep a presence in NATO, but I'm going to be judicious as to how to use the military.
It needs to be in our vital interest, the mission needs to be clear, and the extra strategy obvious.
I don't disagree with that.
I certainly don't disagree that we ought to get our troops home from places like the Balkans as soon as we can, as soon as the mission is complete.
That's what we did in Haiti.
There are no more than a handful of American military personnel in Haiti now.
And Haitians have their problems, but we gave them a chance to restore democracy.
That's really about all we can do.
But if you have a situation like that right in our backyard with chaos about to break out and flotillas forming to come across the water, and all kinds of violence there, right in one of our neighboring countries there, then I think that we did the right thing there.
And as for this idea of nation building, the phrase sounds grandiose.
And, you know, we can't be -- we can't allow ourselves to get overextended.
I certainly agree with that.
And that's why I've supported building up our capacity.
I've devoted in the budget I've proposed, as I said last week, more than twice as much as the governor has proposed.
I think that it's in better shape now than he generally does.
We've had some disagreements about that.
He said that two divisions would have to report not ready for duty, and that's not what the joint chiefs say.
But there's no doubt that we have to continue building up readiness and military strength.
And we have to also be very cautious in the way we use our military.
In the non-military area of influencing events around the world, the financial and economic area, the World Bank President Wolfensohn said recently, Governor, that U.S. contributions to overseas development assistance is lower now almost than it has ever been.
Is that a problem for you?
Do you think -- what is your -- what is your idea about what the United States' obligations are?
I'm talking about financial assistance and that sort of thing to other countries, the poor countries.
Well, I mentioned Third World debt.
Sure.
That's a place where we can use our generosity to influence in a positive way, influence nations.
I believe we ought to have foreign aid, but I don't think we ought to just have foreign aid for the sake of foreign aid.
I think foreign aid needs to be used to encourage markets and reform.
I think a lot of times we just spend aid and say we feel better about it and it ends up being spent the wrong way, and there's some pretty egregious examples recently.
One being Russia, where we had IMF loans that ended up in the pockets of a lot of powerful people and didn't help the nation.
I think the IMF has got a role in the world, but I don't want to see the IMF out there as a way to say to world bankers, if you make a bad loan, we'll bail you out.
It needs to be available for emergency situations.
I thought the President did the right thing with Mexico and was very strongly supportive of the administration in Mexico.
But I don't think the IMF ought to be a stop loss for people who ought to be able to evaluate risks themselves.
So I'll look at every place where we're investing money.
I just want to make sure the return is good.
Do you think we're meeting our obligations properly?
No, I would make some changes.
I think there need to be reforms in the IMF.
I've generally supported it, but I've seen them make some calls that I thought were highly questionable.
And I think that there's a general agreement in many parts of the world now that there ought to be changes in the IMF.
The World Bank I think is generally doing a better job, but I think one of the big issues here that doesn't get nearly enough attention is the issue of corruption.
The governor mentioned it earlier.
I've worked on this issue.
It's an enormous problem and corruption in official agencies, like militaries and police departments around the world, customs officials, that's one of the worst forms of it.
And we have got to again lead by example and help these other countries that are trying to straighten out their situations find the tools in order to do it.
I just think, Jim, that this is an absolutely unique period in world history.
The worldâ€™s coming together, as I said, they're looking to us.
And we have a fundamental choice to make.
Are we going to step up to the plate as a nation the way we did after World War II, the way that generation of heroes said okay, the United States is going to be the leader.
And the world benefitted tremendously from the courage that they showed in those post-war years.
I think that in the aftermath of the Cold War, it's time for us to do something very similar, to step up to the plate, to provide the leadership on the environment, leadership to make sure the world economy keeps moving in the right direction.
Again, that means not running big deficits here and not squandering our surplus.
It means having intelligent decisions that keep our prosperity going and shepherds that economic strength so that we can provide that leadership role.
Let me comment on that.
I'm not so sure the role of the United States is to go around the world and say this is the way it's got to be.
We can help.
And maybe it's just our difference in government, the way we view government.
I want to empower the people.
I want to help people help themselves, not have government tell people what to do.
I just don't think it's the role of the United States to walk into a country and say, â€œwe do it this way, so should you.â€ I think we can help.
I know we've got to encourage democracy in the marketplaces.
But take Russia, for example.
We went into Russia, we said here is some IMF money, and it ended up in Viktor Chemomyrdin's pocket, and others, and yet we played like there was reform.
The only people that are going to reform Russia are Russia.
They're going to have to make the decision themselves.
Mr. Putin is going to have to make the decision as to whether or not he wants to adhere to rule of law and normal accounting practices so that if countries and/or entities invest capital, there's a reasonable rate of return, a way to get the money out of the economy.
But Russia has to make the decision.
We can work with them on security matters, for example, but it's their call to make.
So I'm not exactly sure where the vice president is coming from, but I think one way for us to end up being viewed as the ugly American is for us to go around the world saying, â€œwe do it this way, so should you.â€ Now, we trust freedom.
We know freedom is a powerful, powerful, powerful force, much bigger than the United States of America, as we saw recently in the Balkans.
But maybe I misunderstand where you're coming from, Mr. Vice President, but I think the United States must be humble and must be proud and confident of our values, but humble in how we treat nations that are figuring out how to chart their own course.
Lets move on.
No, let's move on.
Far be it from me to suggest otherwise.
(LAUGHTER)
First, a couple of follow-ups from the vice presidential debate last week.
Vice President Gore,
