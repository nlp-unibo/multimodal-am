But I feel very strongly about that.
And if I'm elected president, I will do something about that.
But I think that we -- I think we have to start with better parenting.
But I don't think that we can ignore the role played by guns.
I mean, the fact is that there -- even though no state wants them, there are guns in some schools.
And the reason it's so difficult for schools to control that is because in recent years there has been a flood of cheap handguns that are so widely available that kids are finding ways to get ahold of them.
And I think that if you look at the situation as it exists here in the United States compared to any other country in the world, it seems to me pretty obvious that while we respect the rights of hunters and sportsmen, we do need some common sense gun safety steps to stem this flood of guns that are getting into the wrong hands.
Yeah, no question about that, but there also needs to be strong enforcement of the law.
Some kid who feels like -- doesn't matter where the gun comes from, it could be a cheap gun, expensive gun.
What matters is something in this person's head says there is not going to be a consequence.
So in my state we toughen up the juvenile justice laws.
We added beds.
We're tough.
We believe in tough love.
We say, if you get caught carrying a gun, you're automatically detained.
And that's what needs to happen.
We've got laws.
If laws need to be strengthened, like instant background checks, that's important.
New question.
As I was saying.
Both of you -- Governor, both of you have talked much about Medicare and health care for seniors.
What about the more than 40 million younger Americans who do not have health insurance right now?
What would you do about that?
Well, I've got a plan to do something about that.
It's to make health care affordable and available this way.
First, there's some who should be buying health care who choose not to.
There's some --
Some of the 40 million.
Some of the healthy folks, healthy young kids say I'll never get sick, therefore I don't need health care right now.
For those what I think we need to do is to develop an investment-type vehicle that would be an incentive for them to invest, like medical savings accounts with rollover capacity.
In other words, you say to a youngster, it will be in your financial interest to start saving for future illness, but for the working folks that do want to have health care that can't afford it, a couple of things we need to do.
One, we need more community health centers.
I've developed -- put out money in my budget to expand community health centers all around the country.
These are places where people can get primary care.
Secondly -- and they're good.
They're very important parts of the safety net of health care.
Secondly, that you get a $2,000 rebate from the government if you're a family of $30,000 or less -- it scales down as you get higher -- that you can use to purchase health care in the private markets.
It will be a huge down payment for a pretty darn good system.
If you allow -- also allow -- convince states to -- allow states to allow the mother to match some of the children's health insurance money with it, the pool purchasing power.
And to make health care more affordable, allow business associations like the National Federal of Independent Business or the Chamber of Commerce or the National Restaurant Association to write association plans across jurisdictional lines so that small businesses have got the capacity to have national pooling to drive the cost of insurance down.
I think that's the very best way to go.
It empowers people, it trusts people, it makes -- and it's a practical way to encourage people to purchase health care insurance.
Vice President Gore?
It's one of my top priorities, Jim, to give every single child in the United States affordable health care within the next four years.
I would like to see eventually in this country some form of universal health care, but I'm not for a government-run system.
In fact, I'm for shrinking the size of government.
I want a smaller and smarter government.
I have been in charge of this reinventing government streamlining project that's reduced the size of government by more than 300,000 people in the last several years.
And the budget plan that I've put out, according to the "Los Angeles Times" again, the way these things are typically measured as a percentage of the GDP, will bring government spending down to the lowest level in 50 years.
So I want to proceed carefully to cover more people.
But I think we should start by greatly expanding the so-called child health insurance or CHIP program to give health insurance to every single child in this country.
I think it's intolerable that we have so many millions of children without any health insurance.
So it's one of my top priorities.
Now, I know that we have some disagreements on this.
And I'm sorry to tell you that, you know, there is a record here.
And Texas ranks 49th out of the 50 states in health care -- in children with health care.
49th for women with health care, and 50th for families with health care.
So it is a priority for me.
I guarantee you.
I'm not aware of any program -- well, I'll just leave it at that.
I think it ought to be a top priority.
Governor, did the -- are the vice president's figures correct about Texas?
First of all, let me say he's not for a government-run health care system?
I thought that's exactly what he and Mrs. Clinton and them fought for in 1993 was a government-run health care system.
It was fortunately stopped in its tracks.
Secondly, we spend $4.7 billion a year on the uninsured in the State of Texas.
Our rate of uninsured, the percentage of uninsured in Texas has gone down, while the percentage of uninsured in America has gone up.
Our CHIPS program got a late start because our government meets only four months out of every two years, Mr. Vice President.
It may come as a shock for somebody who has been in Washington for so long.
But actually limited government can work in the second largest state in the union.
And therefore Congress passes the bill after our session in 1997 ended, we passed an enabling legislation in 1999.
We've signed up over 110,000 children to the CHIPS program.
For comparable states our size, we're signing them up as fast as any other state.
You can quote all the numbers you want, but I'm telling you we care about our people in Texas.
We spent a lot of money to make sure people get health care in the State of Texas, and we're doing a better job than they are at the national level for reducing uninsured.
Is he right?
Well, I don't know about all these percentages that he throws out, but I do know that -- I speculate that the reason why he didn't answer your question directly as to whether my numbers were right, the facts were right about Texas ranking dead last in families with health insurance and 49th out of 50 for both children and women, is because those facts are correct.
And as for why it happened, I'm no expert on the Texas procedures, but what my friends there tell me is that the governor opposed a measure put forward by Democrats in the legislature to expand the number of children that would be covered.
And instead directed the money toward a tax cut, a significant part of which went to wealthy interests.
He declared the need for a new tax cut for the oil companies in Texas an emergency need, and so the money was taken away from the CHIP program.
There's -- you don't have to take my word for this.
There is now a federal judge's opinion about the current management of this program ordering the State of Texas to do -- you should read that judge's language about this.
I believe there are 1.4 million children in Texas who do not have health insurance.
600,000 of whom, and maybe some of those have since gotten it, but as of a year ago 600,000 of them were actually eligible for it but they couldn't sign up for it because of the barriers that they had set up.
Let's let the governor respond to that.
Are those numbers correct?
Are his charges correct?
If he's trying to allege that I'm a hard-hearted person and I don't care about children, he's absolutely wrong.
We've spent $4.7 billion a year in the State of Texas for uninsured people.
And they get health care.
Now, it's not the most efficient way to get people health care.
But I want to remind you, the number of uninsured in America during their watch has increased.
He can make any excuse he wants, but the facts are that we're reducing the number of uninsured percentage of our population.
And as the percentage of the population is increasing nationally, somehow the allegation that we don't care and we're going to give money for this interest or that interest and not for children in the State of Texas is totally absurd.
Let me just tell you who the jury is.
The people of Texas.
There's only been one governor ever elected to back-to-back four-year terms, and that was me.
And I was able to do so with a lot of Democrat votes, nearly 50% of the Hispanic vote, about 27% of the African-American vote, because people know I'm a conservative person and a compassionate person.
So he can throw all the kinds of numbers around.
I'm just telling you our state comes together to do what is right.
We come together both Republicans and Democrats.
Let me put that directly to you, Vice President Gore.
The reason you brought this up, is it -- are you suggesting that those numbers and that record will reflect the way Governor Bush will operate in this area of health insurance as president?
Yes, yes.
But it's not a statement about his heart.
I don't claim to know his heart.
I think he's a good person.
I make no allegations about that.
I believe him when he says that he has a good heart.
I know enough about your story to admire a lot of the things that you have done as a person.
But I think it's about his priorities.
And let me tell you exactly why I think that the choice he made to give a tax cut for the oil companies and others before addressing this -- I mean, if you were the governor of a state that was dead last in health care for families, and all of a sudden you found yourself with the biggest surplus your state had ever had in its history, wouldn't you want to maybe use some of it to climb from 50th to, say, 45 or 40 or something or maybe better?
I would.
Now, but here is why it's directly relevant, Jim.
Because by his own budget numbers, his proposals for spending on tax cuts for the wealthiest of the wealthy are more than the new spending proposals that he has made for health care and education and national defense all combined.
According to his own numbers.
So it's not a question of his heart, as far as I know.
It's a question of priorities and values.
See, you know --
Let me ask --
First of all, that's simply not true what he just said, of course.
And secondly, I repeat to you --
What is not true, Governor?
That we spent -- the top 1% receive 223 as opposed to 445 billion in new spending.
The top -- let's talk about my tax plan.
The top 1% will pay one-third of all the federal income taxes.
And in return, get one-fifth of the benefits, because most of the tax reductions go to the people at the bottom end of the economic ladder.
That stands in stark contrast, by the way, to a man who is going to leave 50 million -- 50 million Americans out of tax relief.
We just have a different point of view.
It's a totally different point of view.
He believes only the right people ought to get tax relief.
I believe everybody who pays taxes ought to get tax relief.
Let me go back to Texas, for example, for a minute.
We pay 4.7 billion.
I can't emphasize to you how much.
I signed a bill that puts CHIPS in place.
The bill finally came out at the end of the 1999 session.
We're working hard to sign up children.
We're doing it faster than any other state our size, comparable state.
We're making really good progress.
And our state cares a lot about our children.
My priority is going to be the health of our citizens.
These folks have had eight years to get something done in Washington, D.C. on the uninsured.
They have not done it.
They've had eight years to get something done on Medicare.
And they have not got it done.
And my case to the American people is, if you're happy with inactivity, stay with the horse.
The horse is up here now.
But if you want change, you need to get somebody that knows how to bring Republicans and Democrats together to get positive things done for America.
New question, new subject.
Vice President Gore, on the environment.
In your 1992 book you said, quote, "We must make the rescue of our environment the central organizing principle for civilization and there must be a wrenching transformation to save the planet."
Do you still feel that way?
I do.
I think that in this 21st century we will soon see the consequences of what's called global warming.
There was a study just a few weeks ago suggesting that in summertime the north polar ice cap will be completely gone in 50 years.
Already many people see the strange weather conditions that the old timers say they've never seen before in their lifetimes.
And what's happening is the level of pollution is increasing significantly.
Now, here is the good news, Jim.
If we take the leadership role and build the new technologies, like the new kinds of cars and trucks that Detroit is itching to build, then we can create millions of good new jobs by being first into the market with these new kinds of cars and trucks and other kinds of technologies.
You know the Japanese are breathing down our necks on this.
They're moving very rapidly because they know that it is a fast-growing world market.
Some of these other countries, particularly in the developing world, their pollution is much worse than anywhere else and their people want higher standards of living.
And so they're looking for ways to satisfy their desire for a better life and still reduce pollution at the same time.
I think that holding onto the old ways and the old argument that the environment and the economy are in conflict is really outdated.
We have to be bold.
We have to provide leadership.
Now it's true that we disagree on this.
The governor said that he doesn't think this problem is necessarily caused by people.
He's for letting the oil companies into the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.
Houston has just become the smoggiest city in the country.
And Texas is number one in industrial pollution.
We have a very different outlook.
And I'll tell you this, I will fight for a clean environment in ways that strengthen our economy.
Governor?
Well, let me start with Texas.
We are a big industrial state.
We reduced our industrial waste by 11%.
We cleaned up more brown fields than any other administration in my state's history, 450 of them.
Our water is cleaner now.
Explain what a brown field is to those who don't follow this.
A brown field is an abandoned industrial site that just sits idle in some of our urban centers.
And people are willing to invest capital in the brown fields don't want to do so for fear of lawsuit.
I think we ought to have federal liability protection, depending upon whether or not standards have been met.
The book you mentioned that Vice President Gore wrote, he also called for taxing -- big energy taxes in order to clean up the environment.
And now that the energy prices are high, I guess he's not advocating those big energy taxes right now.
I believe we ought to fully fund the Land and Water Conservation Fund to -- with half the money going to states so states can make the right decisions for environmental quality.
I think we need to have clean coal technologies.
I propose $2 billion worth.
By the way, I just found out the other day an interesting fact, that there is a national petroleum reserve right next to -- in Prudhoe Bay that your administration opened up for exploration in that pristine area.
And it was a smart move because there's gas reserves up there.
We need gas pipelines to bring the gas down.
Gas is a clean fuel that we can burn to -- we need to make sure that if we decontrol our plants that there's mandatory -- that the plants must conform to clean air standards, the grandfathered plants, that's what we did in Texas.
No excuses.
You must conform.
In other words, there are practical things we can do.
But it starts with working in a collaborative effort with states and local folks.
If you own the land, every day is Earth Day.
People care a lot about their land and care about their environment.
Not all wisdom is in Washington, D.C. on this issue.
Where do you see the basic difference in very simple terms in two or three sentences between you and the governor on the environment?
If a voter wants to make a choice, what is it?
I'm really strongly committed to clean water and clean air, and cleaning up the new kinds of challenges like global warming.
He is right that I'm not in favor of energy taxes.
I am in favor of tax cuts to encourage and give incentives for the quicker development of these new kinds of technologies.
And let me say again, Detroit is rearing to go on that.
We differ on the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, as I have said.
We differ on whether or not pollution controls ought to be voluntary.
I don't think you can -- I don't think you can get results that way.
We differ on the kinds of appointments that we would make.
Would you say it's a fundamental difference?
I think it's a fundamental difference.
Let me give you an example.
Hold on one second.
Okay, sure.
We've talked about supply.
I just want to know for somebody -- we're getting close to the end of our time here.
If somebody wanted to vote on the environment, how would you draw the differences, Governor?
Well, I don't believe in command and control out of Washington, D.C.
I believe Washington ought to set standards, but again I think we ought to be collaborative at the local levels and I think we ought to work with people at the local levels.
And by the way, I just want to make sure -- I can't let him just say something and not correct it.
The electric decontrol bill that I fought for and signed in Texas has mandatory emission standards, Mr. Vice President.
That's what we ought to do at the federal level when it comes to grandfathered plants for utilities.
I think there's a difference.
I think, for example, take -- when they took 40 million acres of land out of circulation without consulting local officials, I thought that was --
That was out in the west?
Out in the west, yeah.
And so -- on the logging issue.
That's not the way I would have done it.
Perhaps some of that land needs to be set aside.
But I certainly would have consulted with governors and elected officials before I would have acted unilaterally.
Would you believe the federal government still has some new rules and new regulations and new laws to pass in the environmental area or do you think --
Sure, absolutely, so long as they're based upon science and they're reasonable.
So long as people have input.
What about global warming?
I think it's an issue that we need to take very seriously.
But I don't think we know the solution to global warming yet.
And I don't think we've got all the facts before we make decisions.
I tell you one thing I'm not going to do is I'm not going to let the United States carry the burden for cleaning up the world's air.
Like Kyoto Treaty would have done.
China and India were exempted from that treaty.
I think we need to be more even-handed, as
