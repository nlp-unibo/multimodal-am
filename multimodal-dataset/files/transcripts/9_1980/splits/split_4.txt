or in a careless way in a belligerent attitude which has exemplified his attitudes in the past.
Barbara, would you repeat the question for Governor Reagan?
Yes, thank you.
Realizing that you may be equally reluctant to speak ill of your opponent, may I ask why people should not vote for your opponent, why his Presidency could be harmful to the nation, and having examined both your opponent's record and the man himself, could you tell us his greatest weakness?
Well, Barbara, I believe that there is a fundamental difference - and I think it has been evident in most of the answers that Mr. Carter has given tonight - that he seeks the solution to anything as another opportunity for a Federal Government program.
I happen to believe that the Federal Government has usurped powers of autonomy and authority that belong back at the state and local level.
It has imposed on the individual freedoms of the people, and there are more of these things that could be solved by the people themselves, if they were given a chance, or by the levels of government that were closer to them.
Now, as to why I should be and he shouldn't be, when he was a candidate in 1976, President Carter invented a thing he called the misery index.
He added the rate of unemployment and the rate of inflation, and it came, at that time, to 12.5% under President Ford.
He said that no man with that size misery index has a right to seek reelection to the Presidency.
Today, by his own decision, the misery index is in excess of 20%, and I think this must suggest something.
But, when I had quoted a Democratic President, as the President says, I was a Democrat.
I said many foolish things back in those days.
But the President that I quoted had made a promise, a Democratic promise, and I quoted him because it was never kept.
And today, you would find that that promise is at the very heart of what Republicanism represents in this country today.
That's why I believe there are going to be millions of Democrats that are going to vote with us this time around, because they too want that promise kept.
It was a promise for less government and less taxes and more freedom for the people.
President Carter?
I mentioned the radical departure of Governor Reagan from the principles or ideals of historical perspective of his own party.
I don't think that can be better illustrated than in the case of guaranteeing women equal rights under the Constitution of our nation.
For 40 years, the Republican Party platforms called for guaranteeing women equal rights with a constitutional amendment.
Six predecessors of mine who served in the Oval Office called for this guarantee of women's rights.
Governor Reagan and his new Republican Party have departed from this commitment - a very severe blow to the opportunity for women to finally correct discrimination under which they have suffered.
When a man and a women do the same amount of work, a man gets paid $1.00, a women only gets paid 59 cents.
And the equal rights amendment only says that equality of rights shall not be abridged for omen b the Federal Government or by he state governments.
That is all it says a simple guarantee of equality of opportunity which typifies the Democratic arty, and which is a very important commitment of mine, as contrasted with Governor Reagan's radical departure from the long-standing policy of his own party.
Governor Reagan?
Yes.
Mr. President, once again, I happen to be against the amendment, because I think the amendment will take this problem out of the hands of elected legislators and put it in the hands f unelected judges.
I am for equal rights, and while you have been in office for four ears and not one single state - and most f them have a majority of Democratic legislators - has added to the ratification r voted to ratify the equal rights amendment.
While I was Governor, more than eight years ago, I found 14 separate instances where women were discriminated against in the body of California law, and I had passed and signed into law 14 statutes that eliminated those discriminations, including the economic ones that you have just mentioned - equal pay and so forth.
I believe that if in all these years that we have spent trying to get the amendment, that we had spent as much time correcting these laws, as we did in California - and we were the first to do it.
If I were President, I would also now take a look at the hundreds of Federal regulations which discriminate against women and which go right on while everyone is looking for an amendment.
I would have someone ride herd on those regulations, and we would start eliminating those discriminations in the Federal Government against women.
President Carter?
Howard, I'm a Southerner, and I share the basic beliefs of my region that an excessive government intrusion into the private affairs of American citizens and also into the private affairs of the free enterprise system.
One of the commitments that I made was to deregulate the major industries of this country.
We've been remarkably successful, with the help of a Democratic Congress.
We have deregulated the air industry, the rail industry, the trucking industry, financial institutions.
We're now working on the communications industry.
In addition to that, I believe that this element of discrimination is something that the South has seen so vividly as a blight on our region of the country which has now been corrected - not only racial discrimination but discrimination against people that have to work for a living - because we have been trying to pick ourselves up by our bootstraps, since the long depression years, and lead a full and useful life in the affairs of this country.
We have made remarkable success.
It is part of my consciousness and of my commitment to continue this progress.
So, my heritage as a Southerner, my experience in the Oval Office, convinces me that what I have just described is a proper course for the future.
Governor Reagan, yours is the last word.
Well, my last word is again to say this: We were talking about this very simple amendment and women's rights.
And I make it plain again: I am for women's rights.
But I would like to call the attention of the people to the fact that that so-called simple amendment would be used by mischievous men to destroy discriminations that properly belong, by law, to women respecting the physical differences between the two sexes, labor laws that protect them against things that would be physically harmful to them.
Those would all, could all be challenged by men.
And the same would be true with regard to combat service in the military and so forth.
I thought that was the subject we were supposed to be on.
But, if we're talking about how much we think about the working people and so forth, I'm the only fellow who ever ran for this job who was six times President of his own union and still has a lifetime membership in that union.
Gentlemen, each of you now has three minutes for a closing statement.
President Carter, you're first.
First of all, I'd like to thank the League of Women Voters for making this debate possible.
I think it's been a very constructive debate and I hope it's helped to acquaint the American people with the sharp differences between myself and Governor Reagan.
Also, I want to thank the people of Cleveland and Ohio for being such hospitable hosts during these last few hours in my life.
I've been President now for almost four years.
I've had to make thousands of decisions, and each one of those decisions has been a learning process.
I've seen the strength of my nation, and I've seen the crises it approached in a tentative way.
And I've had to deal with those crises as best I could.
As I've studied the record between myself and Governor Reagan, I've been impressed with the stark differences that exist between us.
I think the result of this debate indicates that that fact is true.
I consider myself in the mainstream of my party.
I consider myself in the mainstream even of the bipartisan list of Presidents who served before me.
The United States must be a nation strong; the United States must be a nation secure.
We must have a society that's just and fair.
And we must extend the benefits of our own commitment to peace, to create a peaceful world.
I believe that since I've been in office, there have been six or eight areas of combat evolved in other parts of the world.
In each case, I alone have had to determine the interests of my country and the degree of involvement of my country.
I've done that with moderation, with care, with thoughtfulness; sometimes consulting experts.
But, I've learned in this last three and a half years that when an issue is extremely difficult, when the call is very close, the chances are the experts will be divided almost 50-50.
And the final judgment about the future of the nation - war, peace, involvement, reticence, thoughtfulness, care, consideration, concern - has to be made by the man in the Oval Office.
It's a lonely job, but with the involvement of the American people in the process, with an open Government, the job is a very gratifying one.
The American people now are facing, next Tuesday, a lonely decision.
Those listening to my voice will have to make a judgment about the future of this country.
And I think they ought to remember that one vote can make a lot of difference.
If one vote per precinct had changed in 1960, John Kennedy would never have been President of this nation.
And if a few more people had gone to the polls and voted in 1968, Hubert Humphrey would have been President; Richard Nixon would not.
There is a partnership involved in our nation.
To stay strong, to stay at peace, to raise high the banner of human rights, to set an example for the rest of the world, to let our deep beliefs and commitments be felt by others in other nations, is my plan for the future.
I ask the American people to join me in this partnership.
Governor Reagan?
Yes, I would like to add my words of thanks, too, to the ladies of the League of Women Voters for making these debates possible.
I'm sorry that we couldn't persuade the bringing in of the third candidate, so that he could have been seen also in these debates.
But still, it's good that at least once, all three of us were heard by the people of this country.
Next Tuesday is Election Day.
Next Tuesday all of you will go to the polls, will stand there in the polling place and make a decision.
I think when you make that decision, it might be well if you would ask yourself, are you better off than you were four years ago?
Is it easier for you to go and buy things in the stores than it was four years ago?
Is there more or less unemployment in the country than there was four years ago?
Is America as respected throughout the world as itwas?
Do you feel that our security is as safe, that we're as strong as we were four years ago?
And if you answer all of those questions yes, why then, I think your choice is very obvious as to whom you will vote for.
If you don't agree, if you don't think that this course that we've been on for the last four years is what you would like to see us follow for the next four, then I could suggest another choice that you have.
This country doesn't have to be in the shape that it is in.
We do not have to go on sharing in scarcity with the country getting worse off, with unemployment growing.
We talk about the unemployment lines.
If all of the unemployed today were in a single line allowing two feet for each of them, that line would reach from New York City to Los Angeles, California.
All of this can be cured and all of it can be solved.
I have not had the experience the President has had in holding that office, but I think in being Governor of California, the most populous state in the Union - if it were a nation, it would be the seventh-ranking economic power in the world - I, too, had some lonely moments and decisions to make.
I know that the economic program that I have proposed for this nation in the next few years can resolve many of the problems that trouble us today.
I know because we did it there.
We cut the cost - the increased cost of government - in half over the eight years.
We returned $5.7 billion in tax rebates, credits and cuts to our people.
We, as I have said earlier, fell below the national average in inflation when we did that.
And I know that we did give back authority and autonomy to the people.
I would like to have a crusade today, and I would like to lead that crusade with your help.
And it would be one to take Government off the backs of the great people of this country, and turn you loose again to do those things that I know you can do so well, because you did them and made this country great.
Thank you.
