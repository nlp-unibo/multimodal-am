oil could plunge the United States into depression.
The question is whether the development of alternative energy sources, in order to reduce this dependence, can be done without damaging the environment, and will it mean for American families steadily higher fuel bills?
I'm not so sure that it means steadily higher fuel costs, but I do believe that this nation has been portrayed for too long a time to the people as being energy-poor when it is energy-rich.
The coal that the President mentioned - yes, we have it - and yet one-eighth of our total coal resources is not being utilized at all right now.
The mines are closed down; there are 22000 miners out of work.
Most of this is due to regulations which either interfere with the mining of it or prevent the burning of it:.
With our modern technology, yes, we can burn our coal within the limits of the Clean Air Act.
I think, as technology improves, we'll be able to do even better with that.
The other thing is that we have only leased out - begun to explore - 2% of our outer continental shelf for oil, where it is believed, by everyone familiar with that fuel and that source of energy, that there are vast supplies yet to be found.
Our Government has, in the last year or so, taken out of multiple use millions of acres of public lands that once were - well, they were public lands subject to multiple use - exploration for minerals and so forth.
It is believed that probably 70% of the potential oil in the United States is probably hidden in those lands, and no one is allowed to even go and explore to find out if it is there.
This is particularly true of the recent efforts to shut down part of Alaska.
Nuclear power: There were 36 power plants planned in this country.
And let me add the word safety; it must be done with the utmost of safety.
But 32 of those have given up and canceled their plans to build, and again, because Government regulations and permits, and so forth, take - make it take - more than twice as long to build a nuclear plant in the United States as it does to build one in Japan or in Western Europe.
We have the sources here.
We are energy rich, and coal is one of the great potentials we have.
President Carter, your comment?
To repeat myself, we have this year the opportunity, which we'll realize, to produce 800 million tons of coal - an unequaled record in the history of our country.
Governor Reagan says that this is not a good achievement, and he blames restraints on coal production on regulations - regulations that affect the life and the health and safety of miners, and also regulations that protect the purity of our air and the quality our water and our land.
We cannot cast aside these regulations.
We have a chance in the next 15 years, insisting upon the health and safety of workers in the mines, and also preserving the same high air and water pollution standards, to triple the amount of coal we produce.
Governor Reagan's approach to our energy policy, which has already proven its effectiveness, is to repeal, or to change substantially, the windfall profits tax - to return a major portion of $227 billion back to the oil companies; to do away with the Department of Energy; to short-circuit our synthetic fuels program; to put a minimal emphasis on solar power; to emphasize strongly nuclear power plants as a major source of energy in the future.
He wants to put all our eggs in one basket and give that basket to the major oil companies.
Governor Reagan.
That is a misstatement, of course, of my position.
I just happen to believe that free enterprise can do a better job of producing the things that people need than government can.
The Department of Energy has a multi-billion-dollar budget in excess of $10 billion.
It hasn't produced a quart of oil or a lump of coal, or anything else in the line of energy.
And for Mr. Carter to suggest that I want to do away with the safety laws and with the laws that pertain to clean water and clean air, and so forth.
As Governor of California, I took charge of passing the strictest air pollution laws in the United States - the strictest air quality law that has even been adopted in the United States.
And we created an OSHA - an Occupational Safety and Health Agency - for the protection of employees before the Federal Government had one in place.
And to this day, not one of its decisions or rulings has ever been challenged.
So, I think some of those charges are missing the point.
I am suggesting that there are literally thousands of unnecessary regulations that invade every facet of business, and indeed, very much of our personal lives, that are unnecessary; that Government can do without; that have added $130 billion to the cost of production in this country; and that are contributing their part to inflation.
And I would like to see us a little more free, as we once were.
President Carter, another crack at that?
Sure.
As a matter of fact,.
the air pollution standard laws that were passed in California were passed over the objections of Governor Reagan, and this is a very well-known fact.
Also, recently, when someone suggested that the Occupational Safety and Health Act should be abolished, Governor Reagan responded, amen.
The offshore drilling rights is a question that Governor Reagan raises often.
As a matter of fact, in the proposal for the Alaska lands legislation, 100% of all the offshore lands would be open for exploration, and 95% of all the Alaska lands, where it is suspected or believed that minerals might exist.
We have, with our five-year plan for the leasing of offshore lands, proposed more land to be drilled than has been opened up for drilling since this program first started in 1954.
So we're not putting restraints on American exploration, we're encouraging it in every way we can.
Governor Reagan, you have the last word on this question.
Yes.
If it is a well-known fact that I opposed air pollution laws in California, the only thing I can possibly think of is that the President must be suggesting the law that the Federal Government tried to impose on the State of California - not a law, but regulations - that would have made it impossible to drive an automobile within the city limits of any California city, or to have a place to put it if you did drive it against their regulations.
It would have destroyed the economy of California, and, I must say, we had the support of Congress when we pointed out how ridiculous this attempt was by the Environmental Protection Agency.
We still have the strictest air control, or air pollution laws in the country.
As for offshore oiling, only 2% now is so leased and is producing oil.
The rest, as to whether the lands are going to be opened in the next five years or so - we're already five years behind in what we should be doing.
There is more oil now, in the wells that have been drilled, than has been taken out in 121 years that they've been drilled.
Thank you Governor.
Thank you, Mr. President.
The next question goes to Governor Reagan from William Hilliard.
Governor Reagan, wage earners in this country - especially the young - are supporting a Social Security system that continues to affect their income drastically.
The system is fostering a struggle between the young and the old, and is drifting the country toward a polarization of these two groups.
How much longer can the young wage earner expect to bear the ever-increasing burden of the Social Security system?
The Social Security system was based on a false premise, with regard to how fast the number of workers would increase and how fast the number of retirees would increase.
It is actuarially out of balance, and this first became evident about 16 years ago, and some of us were voicing warnings then.
Now, it is trillions of dollars out of balance, and the only answer that has come so far is the biggest single tax increase in our nation's history - the payroll tax increase for Social Security - which will only put a band-aid on this and postpone the day of reckoning by a few years at most.
What is needed is a study that I have proposed by a task force of experts to look into this entire problem as to how it can be reformed and made actuarially sound, but with the premise that no one presently dependent on Social Security is going to have the rug pulled out from under them and not get their check.
We cannot frighten, as we have with the threats and the campaign rhetoric that has gone on in this campaign, our senior citizens - leave them thinking that in some way, they're endangered and they would have no place to turn.
They must continue to get those checks, and I believe that the system can be put on a sound actuarial basis.
But it's going to take some study and some work, and not just passing a tax increase to let the load - or the roof - fall in on the next administration.
Would you repeat that question for President Carter?
Yes.
President Carter, wage earners in this country, especially the young, are supporting a Social Security System that continues to affect their income drastically.
The system is fostering a struggle between young and old and is drifting the country toward a polarization of these two groups.
How much longer can the young wage earner expect to bear the ever-increasing burden of the Social Security System?
As long as there is a Democratic President in the White House, we will have a strong and viable Social Security System, free of the threat of bankruptcy.
Although Governor Reagan has changed his position lately, on four different occasions, he has advocated making Social Security a voluntary system, which would, in effect, very quickly bankrupt it.
I noticed also in The Wall Street Journal early this week, that a preliminary report of his task force advocates making Social Security more sound by reducing the adjustment in Social Security for the retired people to compensate for the impact of inflation.
These kinds of approaches are very dangerous to the security, the well being and the peace of mind of the retired people of this country and those approaching retirement age.
But no matter what it takes in the future to keep Social Security sound, it must be kept that way.
And although there was a serious threat to the Social Security System and its integrity during the 1976 campaign and when I became President, the action of the Democratic Congress working with me has been to put Social Security back on a sound financial basis.
That is the way it will stay.
Governor Reagan?
Well, that just isn't true.
It has, as I said, delayed the actuarial imbalance falling on us for just a few years with that increase in taxes, and I don't believe we can go on increasing the tax, because the problem for the young people today is that they are paying in far more than they can ever expect to get out.
Now, again this statement that somehow, I wanted to destroy it and I just changed my tune, that I am for voluntary Social Security, which would mean the ruin of it.
Mr. President, the voluntary thing that I suggested many years ago was that with a young man orphaned and raised by an aunt who died, his aunt was ineligible for Social Security insurance because she was not his mother.
And I suggested that if this is an insurance program, certainly the person who is paying in should be able to name his own beneficiary.
That is the closest I have ever come to anything voluntary with Social Security.
I, too, am pledged to a Social Security program that will reassure these senior citizens of ours that they are going to continue to get their money.
There are some changes that I would like to make.
I would like to make a change in the regulation that discriminates against a wife who works and finds that she then is faced with a choice between her father's or her husband's benefits, if he dies first, or what she has paid in; but it does not recognize that she has also been paying in herself, and she is entitled to more than she presently can get.
I'd like to change that.
President Carter's rebuttal now.
These constant suggestions that the basic Social Security System should be changed does call for concern and consternation among the aged of our country.
It is obvious that we should have a commitment to them, that Social Security benefits should not be taxed and that there would be no peremptory change in the standards by which Social Security payments are made to retired people.
We also need to continue to index Social Security payments, so that if inflation rises, the Social Security payments would rise a commensurate degree to let the buying power of a Social Security check continue intact.
In the past, the relationship between Social Security and Medicare has been very important to providing some modicum of aid for senior citizens in the retention of health benefits.
Governor Reagan, as a matter of fact, began his political career campaigning around this nation against Medicare.
Now, we have an opportunity to move toward national health insurance, with an emphasis on the prevention of disease, an emphasis on out-patient care, not in-patient care; an emphasis on hospital cost containment to hold down the cost of hospital care far those who are ill, an emphasis on catastrophic health insurance, so that if a family is threatened with being wiped out economically because of a very high medical bill, then the insurance would help pay for it.
These are the kinds of elements of a national health insurance, important to the American people.
Governor Reagan, again, typically is against such a proposal.
Governor?
When I opposed Medicare, there was another piece of legislation meeting the same problem before the Congress.
I happened to favor the other piece of legislation and thought that it would be better for the senior citizens and provide better care than the one that was finally passed.
I was not opposing the principle of providing care for them.
I was opposing one piece of legislation versus another.
There is something else about Social Security.
Of course, it doesn't come out of the payroll tax.
It comes out of a general fund, but something should be done about it.
I think it is disgraceful that the Disability Insurance Fund in Social Security finds checks going every month to tens of thousands of people who are locked up in our institutions for crime or for mental illness, and they are receiving disability checks from Social Security every month while a state institution provides for all of their needs and their care.
President Carter, you have the last word on this question.
I think this debate on Social Security, Medicare, national health insurance typifies, as vividly any other subject tonight, the basic historical differences between the Democratic Party and Republican Party.
The allusions to basic changes in the minimum wage is another, and the deleterious comments that Governor Reagan has made about unemployment compensation.
These commitments that the Democratic Party has historically made to the working families of this nation have been extremely important to the growth in their stature and in a better quality of life for them.
I noticed recently that Governor Reagan frequently quotes Democratic presidents in his acceptance address.
I have never heard a candidate for President, who is a Republican, quote a Republican president, but when they get in office, they try to govern like Republicans.
So, it is good fo the American people to remember that there is a sharp basic historical difference between Governor Reagan and me on these crucial issues - also, between the two parties that we represent.
Thank you Mr. President, Governor Reagan.
We now go to another question - a question to President Carter by Barbara Waiters.
Thank you.
You have addressed some of the major issues tonight, but the biggest issue in the mind of American voters is yourselves - your ability to lead this country.
When many voters go into that booth just a week from today, they will be voting their gut instinct about you men.
You have already given us your reasons why people should vote for you, now would you please tell us for this your final question, why they should not vote for your opponent, why his Presidency could be harmful to the nation and, having examined both your opponent's record and the man himself, tell us his greatest weakness.
Barbara, reluctant as I am to say anything critical about Governor Reagan, I will try to answer your question.
First of all, there is the historical perspective that I just described.
This is a contest between a Democrat in the mainstream of my party, as exemplified by the actions that I have taken in the Oval Office the last four years, as contrasted with Governor Reagan, who in most cases does typify his party, but in some cases, there is a radical departure by him from the heritage of Eisenhower and others.
The most important crucial difference in this election campaign, in my judgment, is the approach to the control of nuclear weaponry and the inclination to control or not to control the spread of atomic weapons to other nations who don't presently have it, particularly terrorist nations.
The inclination that Governor Reagan has exemplified in many troubled times since he has been running for President - I think since 1968 - to inject American military forces in places like North Korea, to put a blockade around Cuba this year, or in some instances, to project American forces into a fishing dispute against the small nation of Ecuador on the west coast of South America.
This is typical of his long-standing inclination, on the use of American power, not to resolve disputes diplomatically and peacefully, but to show that the exercise of military power is best proven by the actual use of it.
Obviously, no President wants war, and I certainly do not believe that Governor Reagan, if he were President, would want war, but a President in the Oval Office has to make a judgment on almost a daily basis about how to exercise the enormous power of our country for peace, through diplomacy,
