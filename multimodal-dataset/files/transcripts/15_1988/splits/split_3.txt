around this country what's happening in the volunteer section: Americans helping America.
And I want to keep it alive in child care and in other entitlements.
Margaret Warner for Gov.
Dukakis.
Governor, I'm going to pass on the question I originally planned to ask you, to follow up on your rebuttal to a question Andrea asked, and that involves Social Security.
Now it is true, as you said, that originally you sought an exemption for Social Security COLAs in this national governors' association vote.
But when you lost that vote, you then endorsed the overall freeze proposal.
And what's more, you had great criticism of your fellow governors who wouldn't go along as political cowards.
That is absolutely not true.
You said it takes guts and it takes will.
That is absolutely not true.
It had nothing to do with the debate on Social Security.
It had to do with the discussion we had had the previous day on the overall question of reducing the budget.
My question is: Aren't you demagoguing the Social Security issue?
No, and I have to (Applause)
I just have to correct the record.
That simply isn't true.
Now, we're not a parliamentary body, the National Governors Association.
We vote on resolutions.
If you don't get a two-thirds, then your resolution doesn't pass.
But everybody knew that those of us who voted against the freezing of COLAs did so, we did so emphatically.
And I never made that statement; never would.
The point is that as we look at this nation's future, and we have two very different visions of this future.
I want to move ahead.
The Vice President talks about a thousand points of light.
I'm interested in 240 million points of light.
I'm interested in 240 million citizens in this country who share in the American dream, all of them in every part of this country.
But as we look at the decisions that the next president of the United States is going to have to make, I just don't believe the place you go first is those programs, those so-called entitlements, which provide a basic floor of income and a modest amount of medical care for the elderly, the disabled, for people who can't make their way on their own, and in many cases, have given a great deal to this country.
The Vice President did call Social Security a few years ago basically or largely a welfare program.
It isn't.
It's a contract between generations.
It's something that we pay into now so that we will have a secure retirement, and our parents and grandparents will have a secure retirement.
It's a very sacred contract, and I believe in it.
So that's not where we ought to go.
There are plenty of places to cut.
There's lots we can do in the Pentagon where dishonest contractors have been lining their pockets at the expense of the American taxpayer.
There are we certainly ought to be able to
Governor
Give our farm families a decent income with spending $20to $25 billion a year on farm subsidies, and I'm sure we can do that.
That's where we ought to go, and those are the programs we ought to review first.
One minute for the Vice President.
Well, let me take him up on this question of farm subsidies.
We have a fundamental difference, approach on agriculture.
He favors this supply maintenance or production controls.
He said that.
He's been out in the state saying that, in Midwestern states.
I don't.
I think the farm bill that he criticizes was good legislation, outstanding legislation.
And I believe the answer to the agricultural economy is not to get the government further involved, but to do what I'm suggesting.
In the first place, never go back to that Democratic grain embargo, that liberal Democrat grain embargo that knocked the markets right out from under us and made Mr. Gorbachev say to me when I was here, how do I know you're reliable suppliers?
We never should go back to that.
And we ought to expand our markets abroad.
We ought to have rural enterprise zones.
We ought to move forward swiftly on my ideas of ethanol which would use more corn, and therefore, create a bigger market for our agricultural products.
But let's not go back and keep assailing a farm bill that passed with overwhelming Democrat and Republican support.
Mr. Vice President.
The farm payments are going down because the agricultural economy is coming back.
Margaret Warner has a question for you, Mr. Vice President.
Mr. Vice President, I'd like to cover a subject that wasn't covered in the first debate.
You have said in this campaign, I am an environmentalist, and described yourself as having zero tolerance for polluters.
And yet your record does seem to suggest otherwise.
When you were head of the President's task force on regulatory relief, you did urge EPA to relax regulations involving the elimination of lead from gasoline.
I believe you urged suspension of rules requiring industries to treat toxic waste before discharging them in sewers.
And your group also urged OSHA to weaken the regulations requiring that workers be informed of dangerous chemicals at the work site.
Finally, I believe you did support the President's veto of the Clean Water Act.
My question is, aren't you--how do you square your campaign rhetoric with this record?
90 percent reductions in lead since I chaired that regulatory task force; 90 percent.
It's almost you remember that expression, get the lead out?
It's almost out.
Almost gone.
Clean water?
I'm for clean water.
But what I'm not for what I'm not for is measuring it the way that the Democratic Congress does.
We sent up a good bill on clean water, a sound bill on clean water.
But the only way you can express your love for clean water is to double the appropriations for clean water, and then rant against the deficit.
I am for clean water.
I've been an outdoorsman and a sportsman all my life.
I've been to these national parks.
I led for the Earl Wallop bill or formerly Dingell-Johnson.
I headed the task force when I was a member of the Congress way back in the late '60s on these kinds of things, on the Republican side.
I led for that.
And so I refuse to measure one's commitment as to whether you're going to double the spending.
That is the same old argument that's gotten us into trouble on the deficit side.
So I'll just keep saying, I am one.
I'm not going to go down there and try to dump the sludge from Massachusetts off the beaches off of New Jersey.
I'm not going to do that.
That boo was excessively loud.
Can you add five seconds, Bernie, out of fairness?
Come on, give me five.
I mean, this guy, this is too much.
But I'm not going to do that.
I'm an environmentalist.
I believe in our parks.
I believe in the President's commission on outdoors.
And I'll do a good job, because I am committed.
Gov.
Dukakis, you have one minute to respond.
Margaret, I'm not sure I can get all of this in in one minute.
George, we have supply management today under the 1985 bill.
It's called set-asides.
Secondly, if you were so opposed to the grain embargo, why did you ask the godfather of the grain embargo to be one of your top foreign policy advisers?
I'm against the grain embargo; it was a mistake.
I'm also against the pipeline embargo, which you folks attempted to impose.
That was a mistake as well, and it cost thousands of jobs for American workers in the Midwest and all over the United States of America.
Margaret, once again, I don't know which George Bush I'm talking about here or looking at.
The George Bush who was the charter member of the environmental wrecking crew that went to Washington in the early '80s and did a job on the EPA, or the one we've been seeing and listening to the past two or three months.
But let me say this, because he spent millions and millions of dollars of advertising on the subject of Boston Harbor.
George, Boston Harbor was polluted for 100 years.
I'm the first governor to clean it up.
No thanks to you.
No thanks to you.
We've been cleaning it up for four years.
We passed landmark legislation in '84.
No thanks to you.
You did everything you could to kill the Clean Water Act
Governor.
And those grants which make it possible for states and local communities to clean up rivers and harbors and streams.
(Applause)
Mr. Vice President, Jimmy Carter has called this the worst campaign ever.
Richard Nixon has called it trivial, superficial and inane.
Whoever started down this road first, of negative campaigning, the American people, from all reports coming to us, are completely fed up.
Now, do you have any solutions to suggest?
Is there time left to fix it?
There are 26 days left.
For instance, would you agree to another debate, before it's all over, so that the American people would have another chance before election day to compare you two?
No.
I will not agree to another debate.
The American people are up to here with debates.
They had thirty of them; we had seven of them.
Now we've got three of them.
I am going to carry this election debate all across this country in the last whatever remains of the last three and a half weeks, or whatever we have and the answer is no; I am not going to have any more debates, we don't need any more debates.
I've spelled out my position.
In terms of negative campaigning, you know, I don't want to sound like a kid in the schoolyard: he started it.
But take a look at the Democratic convention take a look at it.
Do you remember the Senator from Boston chanting out there and the ridicule factor from that lady from Texas that was on there; I mean, come on, this was just outrageous.
But I'll try harder to keep it on a high plane.
If you could accept a little criticism, I went all across central Illinois and spoke about agricultural issues, about seven stops.
We had some fun Crystal Gayle and Loretta Lynn with us, and they got up and sang, went to little towns and I talked agriculture.
And not one thing did I see, with respect, on your network about my views on agriculture, and not one did I read in any newspaper.
Why?
Because you are so interested in a poll that might have been coming out, or because somebody had said something nasty about somebody else.
And so I don't know what the answer is.
Somebody hit me and said Barry Goldwater said you ought to talk on issues more.
How can Barry Goldwater sitting in Arizona know whether I'm talking on the issues or not when we put out position paper after position paper, he puts out position paper after position paper; and we see this much about it, because everyone else is fascinated with polls and who's up or down today and who's going to be up or down tomorrow.
So I think we can all share, with respect, in the fact that maybe the message is not getting out.
But it's not getting out because there are too few debates.
There will be no more debates.
(Applause)
Governor Dukakis, you have one minute to respond, sir.
I can understand, after the vice presidential debate, why Mr. Bush would want no more debates.
(Laughter, boos) That's my five seconds.
Andrea, I think we both have a responsibility to try to address the issues.
Yes, we have fundamental differences.
I think a great many of them have come out today.
And I think if we get rid of the labels--and I'm not keeping count, but I think Mr. Bush has used the label "liberal" at least ten times if I had a dollar, George, for every time you used that label, I'd qualify for one of those tax breaks for the rich that you want to give away.
(Laughter, applause) Isn't that the point?
Most Americans believe in basic values.
We have differences about how to achieve them.
I want to move forward, I want this nation to move forward.
I am concerned about the fact that 10 percent of our manufacturing and 20 percent of our banking and nearly half of the real estate in the city of Los Angeles are in the hands of foreign investors.
I am concerned about what that does to our future.
I'm concerned about the fact that so many of our securities are in the hands of foreign banks because of these massive deficits.
But those are the issues on which we ought to be debating and if we can just put away the flag factories and the balloons and those kinds of thing and get on to a real discussion of these issues, I think we will have a good success.
Andrea Mitchell has a question for you, Governor Dukakis.
We are talking about issues, so let's return to something you said earlier about the modernization of land-based missiles.
You said that you didn't rule it out that there are limits to what we can spend, and then you went on to talk about a much more expensive part of our defense strategy, namely, conventional forces.
Do you somehow see conventional forces as a substitute for our strategic forces, and in not talking about the land-based missiles and not committing to modernizing, do you somehow believe that we can have a survivable nuclear force based on the air and sea legs of our triad?
I think we ought to be looking at modernization, I think we ought to be exploring less expensive ways to get it on land, and we ought to make sure that we have an effective and strong and credible nuclear deterrent.
But we also need well-equipped and well-trained and well-supported conventional forces.
And every defense expert I know, including people in the Pentagon itself, will tell you that given the level of defense spending and the level of defense appropriations which the Congress has now approved and the president has signed, there's no way that you can do all of these things and do them well.
That's why tough choices will be required, choices I am prepared to make, Mr. Bush is not prepared to make.
But, Andrea, I think we can go far beyond this as well, because we have opportunities now step-by-step to bring down the level of strategic weapons, get a test ban treaty, negotiate those conventional force reductions.
I would challenge Mr. Gorbachev to join with us in limiting in eliminating regional conflict in the Middle East, in Central America.
Let's get him working on Syria, their client state, and see if we can't get them to join Israel and other Arab nations, if at all possible, and Arab leaders, in finally bringing peace to that troubled region.
And I think that's one reason why we need fresh leadership in the White House that can make progress now in bringing peace to the Middle East.
Let's go to work and end this fiasco in Central America, a failed policy which has actually increased Cuban and Soviet influence.
The democratic leaders of Central and Latin America want to work with us.
I've met with them, I know them, I've spent time in South America-speak the language, so does Senator Bentsen.
We want to work with them and build a new relationship, and they with us.
But not a one of those key democratic leaders support our policy in Central America.
And we've got to work with them if we are going to create an environment for human rights and democracy for the people of this hemisphere, and go to work on our single most important problem, and that is the avalanche of drugs that is poring into our country and virtually destroying those countries.
Those are the kinds of priorities for national security and for foreign policy that I want to pursue Mr. Bush and I have major differences on these issues and I hope very much to be president and pursue them.
Mr. Vice President, you have one minute.
In terms of regional tensions, we have now gotten the attention of the Soviet Union.
And the reason we've gotten it is because they see us now as unwilling to make the very kinds of unilateral cuts that have been called for and to go for the discredited freeze.
My opponent had trouble, criticized us, on our policy in Angola.
It now looks, because of steady negotiation, that we may have an agreement that will remove the Cubans from Angola.
We see the Russians coming out of Afghanistan.
That wouldn't have stopped if we hadn't been willing wouldn't have even started, the Soviets coming out, if we hadn't even been willing to support the freedom fighters there.
And the policy in Central America, regrettably, has failed because the Congress has been unwilling to support those who have been fighting for freedom.
Those Sandinistas came in and betrayed the trust of the revolution; they said it was about democracy, and they have done nothing other than solidify their Marxist domination over that country.
Ann Compton for Governor Dukakis.
Governor, nuclear weapons need nuclear material replenished on a regular basis, and just this week yet another nuclear manufacturing plant was closed because of safety concerns.
Some in the Pentagon fear that too much priority has been put on new weapons programs, not enough on current programs, and worry that the resulting shortage would be amounting to nothing less than unilateral nuclear disarmament.
Is that a priority that you feel has been ignored by this administration, or are the Pentagon officials making too much of it?
Well, it's a great concern of mine and I think of all Americans, and perhaps the vice president can tell us what's been going on.
This is another example of misplaced priorities.
An administration which wants to billions on weapons systems that we don't need and can't afford, and now confronts us with a very serious problem, and plants that are supposed to be producing tritium and plutonium and providing the necessary materials for existing weapons.
Yes, if we don't do something about it, we may find ourselves unilaterally, if I may use that term, dismantling some of these weapons.
What's been going on?
Who's been in charge?
Who's been managing this system?
Why have there been these safety violations?
Why are these plants being closed down?
I don't know what the latest cost estimates are, but it's going to be in the range of 25, 50, 75, $100 billion.
Now, somebody has to bear the responsibility for this.
Maybe the Vice President has an answer.
But I'm somebody who believes very strongly in taking care of the fundamentals first before you start new stuff.
And that's something which will be a priority of ours in the new administration because without it, we cannot have the effective and strong and credible nuclear deterrent we must have.
Mr. Vice President, you have one minute.
That is the closest I have ever heard the Governor of Massachusetts come to support anything having to do with nuclear, that's about as close as I've ever heard him Yes, this Savannah River plant needs to be made more safe.
Will he join me in suggesting that we may need another plant?
Maybe in Idaho, to take care of the requirements, nuclear material requirements, for our Defense Department?
I hope he will.
This sounds like real progress here, because we've had a big difference on the safe use of nuclear power for our energy base.
I believe that we must use clean, safe nuclear power.
I believe that the more dependent we become on foreign oil, the less our national security is enhanced.
And therefore, I've made some proposals to strengthen the domestic oil industry by more incentive going in to look for, and find, and produce oil; made some incentives in terms of secondary and tertiary production.
But we're going to have to use more gas, more coal and more safe nuclear power for our energy base.
So I am one who believes that we can
Mr. Vice President.
and must do what he's talking about now.
Ann Compton has a question for you.
Mr. Vice President, as many as 100 officials in this Administration have left the government under an ethical cloud.
Some have been indicted, some convicted.
Many of the cases have involved undue influence once they're outside of government.
If you become president, will you lock that revolving door that has allowed some men and women in the government to come back and lobby the very departments they once managed?
Yes, and I'll apply it to Congress too.
I'll do both.
I'll do both.
Because I think you see, I am one who I get kidded by being a little old fashioned on these things, but I do believe in public service.
I believe that public service is honorable.
And I don't think anybody has a call on people in their Administrations going astray.
His chief education adviser is in jail He's in jail because he betrayed the public trust.
The head of education.
And yet this man, the governor, equated the President to a rotting fish.
He said that a fish rots from the head down as he was going after Ed Meese.
Look, we need the highest possible ethical standards.
I will have an ethical office in the White House that will be under the President's personal concern.
I will see that these standards apply to the United States Congress.
I hope I will do a good job as one who has had a relatively clean record with no conflicts of interest in his own public life, as has the Governor, to exhort young people to get into public service.
But there is no corner on this sleaze factor, believe me.
And it's a disgrace, and I will do my level best to clean it up, recognizing that you can't legislate morality.
But I do believe that with my record in Congress, having led the new Congressmen to a code of ethics through major main emphasis on it in full disclosure, that I've got a good record.
And there are more, if you want to talk about percentage appointments, more Members of Congress who have been under investigation percentage-wise that people in the executive branch.
And so it isn't one and state governments have had a tough time.
His some of his college presidents aren't exactly holier than thou.
So let's not be throwing stones about it.
Let's say, this isn't Democrat or Republican, and it isn't liberal or conservative.
Let's vow to work together to do something about it.
Governor, you have one minute to respond to it.
And I would agree that integrity is not a Republican or a Democratic issue; it's an American issue.
But here again, I don't know which George Bush I'm listening to.
Wasn't this the George Bush that supported Mr. Meese?
Called James Watt an excellent Secretary of the Interior?
Provided support for some of these people, supported the nomination of Robert Bork to the Supreme Court of the United States.
We've had dozens we've had dozens and dozens of officials in this Administration who have left under a cloud, who have left with the special prosecutor in their arm, have been indicted, convicted.
This isn't the kind of Administration we need.
And one of the reasons our selection of a running mate is so important, it is such a test of the kinds of standards we'll set, is because it tells the American people in advance of the election just what kind of people we're looking for.
I picked Lloyd Bentsen.
Mr. Bush picked Dan Quayle.
I think that says a great deal to the American people about the standards we'll set and the quality of the people that we will pick to serve in our Administration.
To each of you candidates, regrettably, I have to inform you that we have come to the end of our questions.
That's a pity.
Before I ask the candidates to make their closing remarks, on behalf of the Commission on Presidential Debates, I would like to thank all of you for joining us this evening.
Governor Dukakis, yours is the first closing statement, sir.
GOU.
28 years ago, as a young man just graduated from law school, I came to this city, came clear across the country, to watch John Kennedy be nominated for the presidency of the United States, right here in Los Angeles.
I never dreamed that some day I would win that nomination and be my party's nominee for president.
That's America.
That's why I'm proud and grateful to be a citizen of this country.
26 days from today you and millions of Americans will choose two people to lead us into the future as president and vice president of the United States.
Our opponents say, things are okay.
Don't rock the boat.
Not to worry.
They say we should be satisfied.
But I don't think we can be satisfied when we're spending $150 billion a year in interest alone on the national debt, much of it going to foreign bankers; or when 25 percent of our high school students are dropping out of school; or when we have 2-1/2 million of our fellow citizens, a third of them veterans, who are homeless and living on streets and in doorways in this country, when Mr. Bush's prescription for our economic future is another tax giveaway to the rich.
We can do better than that.
Not working with government alone, but all of us working together.
Lloyd Bentsen and I are optimists, and so are the American people.
And we ask you for our hand for your hands and your hearts, and your votes on the 8th of November so we can move forward in the future.
Kitty and I are very grateful to all of you for the warmth and the hospitality that you've given to us in your homes and communities all across this country.
We love you, and we're grateful to you for everything that you've given to us.
And we hope that we'll be serving you in the White House in January of 1989.
Thank you, and God bless you.
(Applause)
Vice President Bush, your closing statement, sir.
Sometimes it does seem that a campaign generates more heat than light.
So let me repeat, I do have respect for my opponent, for his family, for the justifiable pride he takes in his heritage.
But we have enormous differences.
I want to hold the line on taxes, and keep this the longest expansion in modern history going until everybody in America benefits.
I want to invest in our children.
Because I mean it when I say I want a kinder and gentler nation.
And by that I want to have child care where the families, the parents, have control.
I want to keep our neighborhoods much, much better in terms of anti-crime, and that's why I would appoint judges that have a little more sympathy for the victims of crime and a little less for the criminals.
That's why I do feel if some police officer is gunned down that the death penalty is required.
I want to help those with disabilities fit into the mainstream.
There is much to be done.
This election is about big things.
And perhaps the biggest is world peace.
And I ask you to consider the experience I have had in working with a President who has revolutionized the situation around the world.
America stands tall again, and as a result, we are credible.
And we have now achieved an historic arms control agreement.
I want to build on that.
I'd love to be able to say to my grandchildren, four years after my first term, I'd like to say, your grandfather, working with the leaders of the Soviet Union, working with the leaders of Europe, was able to ban chemical and biological weapons from the face of the earth.
Lincoln called this country the last best hope of man on earth.
And he was right then, and we still are the last best hope of man on earth.
And I ask for your support on November 8th.
And I will be a good president.
Working together, we can do wonderful things for the United States and the Free World.
Thank you very, very much.
