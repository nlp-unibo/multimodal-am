this year.
If you cut the amount going in 1 out of every $6, then you have to cut the value of each check by 1 out of every $6 unless you come up with the money from somewhere else.
I would like to know from the governor -- I know we're not supposed to ask each other questions -- but I'd be interested in knowing, does that trillion dollars come from the trust fund, or does it come from the rest of the budget?
No.
There's enough money to pay seniors today in the current affairs of Social Security.
The trillion comes from the surplus.
Surplus is money -- more money than needed.
Let me tell you what your plan is.
It's not Social Security plus, it's Social Security plus huge debt.
That is what it is.
You leave future generations with tremendous IOUs.
It's time to have a leader that doesn't put off tomorrow what we should do today.
It's time to have somebody to step up and say look, let's let younger workers take some of their own money and under certain guidelines invest it in the private markets.
The safest of federal investments yields 4%.
That's twice the amount of rate of return than the current Social Security Trust.
It's a fundamental difference of opinion here, folks.
Younger worker after younger worker hears my call that says I trust you.
And you know what, the issue is changing.
Seniors now understand that the promise made will be a promise kept, but younger workers now understand we better have a government that trusts them and that's exactly what I'm going to do.
Could I respond to that, Jim?
This is a big issue.
Could we do another round on it?
We're almost out of time.
Just briefly.
When FDR established Social Security, they didn't call them IOUs, they called it the full faith and credit of the United States.
If you don't have trust in that, I do.
If you take it out of the surplus in the trust fund, that means the trust fund goes bankrupt in this generation within 20 years.
This is a government that thinks a 2% rate of return on your money is satisfactory.
It's not.
This is a government that says younger workers can't possibly have their own assets.
We need to think differently about the issue.
We need to make sure our seniors get the promise made.
If we don't trust younger workers to manage some of their own money with the Social Security surplus, to grow from $1 trillion to $3 trillion, it will be impossible to bridge the gap without it.
What Mr. Gore's plan will do causing huge payroll taxes or major benefit reductions.
New question.
Are there issues of character that distinguish you from Vice President Gore?
The man loves his wife and I appreciate that a lot.
And I love mine.
The man loves his family a lot, and I appreciate that, because I love my family.
I think the thing that discouraged me about the vice president was uttering those famous words, "No controlling legal authority."
I felt like there needed to be a better sense of responsibility of what was going on in the White House.
I believe that -- I believe they've moved that sign, "The buck stops here" from the Oval Office desk to "The buck stops here" on the Lincoln bedroom.
It's not good for the country and it's not right.
We need to have a new look about how we conduct ourselves in office.
There's a huge trust.
I see it all the time when people come up to me and say, I don't want you to let me down again.
And we can do better than the past administration has done.
It's time for a fresh start.
It's time for a new look.
It's time for a fresh start after a season of cynicism.
And so I don't know the man well, but I've been disappointed about how he and his administration have conducted the fundraising affairs.
You know, going to a Buddhist temple and then claiming it wasn't a fundraiser isn't my view of responsibility.
Vice President Gore?
I think we ought to attack our country's problems, not attack each other.
I want to spend my time making this country even better than it is, not trying to make you out to be a bad person.
You may want to focus on scandal.
I want to focus on results.
As I said a couple of months ago, I stand here as my own man and I want you to see me for who I really am.
Tipper and I have been married for 30 years.
We became grandparents a year-and-a-half ago.
We've got four children.
I have devoted 24 years of my life to public service and I've said this before and I'll say it again, if you entrust me with the presidency, I may not be the most exciting politician, but I will work hard for you every day.
I will fight for middle-class families and working men and women and I will never let you down.
So, Governor, what are you saying when you mention the fundraising scandals or the fundraising charges that involve Vice President Gore?
What are you saying that the voters should take from that that's relevant to this election?
They ought to factor in it when they go to the voting booth.
In what way?
I think people need to be held responsible for the actions they take in life.
I think that -- well, I think that's part of the need for a cultural change.
We need to say we each need to be responsible for what we do.
People in the highest office of the land must be responsible for decisions they make in life.
And that's the way I've conducted myself as Governor of Texas and that's the way I'll conduct myself as President of the United States, should I be fortunate enough to earn your vote.
Are you saying all this is irrelevant, Vice President Gore?
No.
I think the American people should take into account who we are as individuals, what our experience is, what our positions are on the issues and proposals are.
I'm asking you to see me for who I really am.
I'm offering you my own vision, my own experience, my own proposals.
And incidentally, one of them is this.
This current campaign financing system has not reflected credit on anybody in either party.
And that's one of the reasons I've said before, and I'll pledge here tonight, if I'm president, the very first bill that Joe Lieberman and I will send to the United States Congress is the McCain-Feingold campaign finance reform bill.
And the reason it's that important is that all of the other issues, whether prescription drugs for all seniors that are opposed by the drug companies or the patient's bill of rights to take the decisions away from the HMOs and give them to the doctors and nurses, opposed by the HMOs and insurance companies, all these other proposals are going to be a lot easier to get passed for the American people if we limit the influence of special interest money and give democracy back to the American people.
And I wish Governor Bush would join me this evening in endorsing the McCain-Feingold Campaign Finance Reform Bill.
You know, this man has no credibility on the issue.
As a matter of fact, I read in the "New York Times" where he said he co-sponsored the McCain-Feingold Campaign Fundraising Bill.
But he wasn't in the Senate with Senator Feingold.
And so, look, I'm going to -- what you need to know about me is I will uphold the law, I'm going to have an attorney general that enforces the law.
The time for campaign funding reform is after the election.
This man has outspent me and the special interests are outspending me.
And I am not going to lay down my arms in the middle of the campaign for somebody who has got no credibility on the issue.
Senator McCain -- hold on one second.
Senator McCain said in August, "It doesn't matter which one of you is President of the United States in January, there is going to be blood on the floor of the United States Senate," and he'll tie up the Senate until campaign finance reform is passed that includes a ban on soft money.
First of all, would you support that effort by him, or would you sign a bill that is finally passed that included --
I would support an effort to ban corporate soft money and labor union soft money so long as there was dues check-off.
I've campaigned on this since the primaries.
I believe there needs to be instant disclosure on the Internet as to who has given to who.
I think we need to fully enforce the law.
I think we need to have an attorney general that says if a law is broken, we'll enforce it.
Be strict and firm about it.
Look, Governor Bush, you have attacked my character and credibility and I am not going to respond in kind.
I think we ought to focus on the problems and not attack each other.
One of the serious problems, hear me well, is that our system of government is being undermined by too much influence coming from special interest money.
We have to get a handle on it.
And like John McCain, I have learned from experience, and it's not a new position for me.
24 years ago I supported full public financing of all federal elections.
And anybody who thinks I'm just saying it, it will be the first bill I send to the Congress.
I want you to know I care passionately about this and I will fight until it becomes law.
I want people to hear what he just said.
He is for full public financing of Congressional elections.
I'm absolutely, adamently opposed to that.
I don't want the government financing congressional elections.
On that wonderful note of disagreement, we have to stop here and we want to go now to your closing statements.
Governor Bush is first.
You have two minutes.
Thank you, Jim.
Thank the University of Massachusetts and Mr. Vice President, thank you.
It has been a good, lively exchange.
There is a huge difference of opinion.
Mine is I want to empower people in their own lives.
I also want to go to Washington to get some positive things done.
It is going to require a new spirit.
A spirit of cooperation.
It will require the ability of a Republican president to reach out across the partisan divide and to say to Democrats, let's come together to do what is right for America.
It's been my record as Governor of Texas, it will be how I conduct myself if I'm fortunate enough to earn your vote as President of the United States.
I want to finally get something done on Medicare.
I want to make sure prescription drugs are available for all seniors.
And I want seniors to have additional choices when it comes to choosing their health care plans.
I want to finally get something done on Social Security.
I want to make sure the seniors have the promise made will be a promise kept, but I want younger workers to be able to manage some of their own money, some of their own payroll taxes in the private sector under certain guidelines to get a better rate of return on your own money.
I want to rebuild our military to keep the peace.
I want to have a strong hand when it comes to the United States in world affairs.
I don't want to try to put our troops in all places at all times.
I don't want to be the world's policeman, I want to be the world's peacemaker by having a military of high morale and a military that is well-equipped.
I want anti-ballistic missile systems to protect ourselves and our allies from a rogue nation that may try to hold us hostage or blackmail our allies and friends.
I want to make sure the education system fulfills its hope and promise.
I've had a strong record of working with Democrats and Republicans in Texas to make sure no child is left behind.
I understand the limited role of the federal government, but it could be a constructive role when it comes to reform, by insisting that there be a strong accountability systems.
My intentions are to earn your vote and earn your confidence.
I'm asking for your vote.
I want you to be on my team.
And for those of you working, thanks from the bottom of my heart.
For those of you making up your mind, I would be honored to have your support.
Vice President Gore, two minutes.
I want to thank everybody who watched and listened tonight because this is indeed a crucial time in American history.
We're at a fork in the road.
We have this incredible prosperity, but a lot of people have been left behind.
And we have a very important decision to make.
Will we use the prosperity to enrich all of our families and not just a few?
One important way of looking at this is to ask who are you going to fight for?
Throughout my career in public service, I have fought for the working men and women of this country, middle-class families.
Why?
Because you are the ones who have the hardest time paying taxes, the hardest time making ends meet.
You are the ones who are making car payments and mortgage payments and doing right by your kids.
And a lot of times there are powerful forces that are against you.
Make no mistake about it, they do have undue influence in Washington, D.C. and it makes a difference if you have a president who will fight for you.
I know one thing about the position of president, it's the only position in our Constitution that is filled by an individual who is given the responsibility to fight not just for one state or one district or the well-connected or wealthy, but to fight for all of the people, including especially those who most need somebody who will stand up and take on whatever powerful forces might stand in the way.
There is a woman named Winifred Skinner here tonight from Iowa.
I mentioned her earlier.
She's 79 years old.
She has Social Security.
I'm not going to cut her benefits or support any proposal that would.
She gets a small pension, but in order to pay for her prescription drug benefits, she has to go out seven days a week several hours a day picking up cans.
She came all the way from Iowa in a Winnebago with her poodle in order attend here tonight.
I want to tell her, I'll fight for a prescription drug benefit for all seniors and fight for the people of this country for a prosperity that benefits all.
