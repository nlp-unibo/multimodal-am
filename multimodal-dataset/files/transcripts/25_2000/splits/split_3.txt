Democrats came together and said what can we do to make our public education the best in the country?
We've done a long way working together to do so.
The cornerstone is to have strong accountability in return for money and in return for flexibility.
We're going to ask you to show us whether or not -- we ask you to post the results on the Internet.
We encourage parents to take a look at the comparative results of schools.
We have a strong charter school movement that I signed the legislation to get started in the State of Texas.
I believe if we find poor children trapped in schools that won't teach, we need to free the parents.
We need to expand education savings accounts.
Something that the vice presidentâ€™s running mate supports.
There's big differences.
He won't support freeing local districts from the strings of federal money.
First of all, I do have mandatory testing.
I think the governor may not have heard what I said clearly.
The voluntary national testing is in addition to the mandatory testing that we require of states.
All schools, all school districts, students themselves, and required teacher testing, which goes a step farther than Governor Bush has been willing to go.
Here are a couple of differences, though, Jim.
Governor Bush is in favor of vouchers which take taxpayer money away from public schools and give them to private schools that are not accountable for how the money is used and don't have to take all applicants.
Now, private schools play a great role in our society.
All of our children have gone to both public schools and private schools.
But I don't think private schools should have a right to take taxpayer money away from public schools at a time when Caley Ellis is standing in that classroom.
Let me give you another example.
I went to a school in Dade County, Florida where the facilities are so overcrowded the children have to eat lunch in shifts with the first shift for lunch starting at 9:30 in the morning.
Look, this is a funding crisis all around the country.
There are fewer parents of school-age children as a percentage of the voting population and there is the largest generation of students ever.
We're in an information age when learning is more important than ever.
90% of our kids go to public schools.
We have to make it the number one priority.
Modernize our schools, reduce class size, recruit new teachers, give every child a chance to learn with one-on-one time in a quality -- high-quality, safe school.
If it's a failing school, shut it down and reopen it under a new principal with a turnaround team of specialists the way Governor Jim Hunt does in North Carolina.
Here is another difference.
The governor, if it's a failing school, would leave the children in that failing school for three years and then give a little bit of money to the parents, a down payment on a down payment for private school tuition, and pretend that that would be enough for them to go out and go to a private school.
It's an illusion.
Wait a minute, Governor.
Okay.
First of all, most of good governance is at the state level.
See, here is the mentality.
I'm going to make the state do this and make the state do that.
All I'm saying is if you spend money, show us results and test every year, which you do not do, Mr. Vice President.
You don't test every year.
You can say you do to the cameras but you don't, unless you've changed your plan here on the stage.
I didn't say that.
You need to test every year.
That's how you determine if children are progressing to excellence.
Secondly, one of the things that we have to be careful about in politics is throwing money at a system that has not yet been reformed.
More money is needed and I spend more money, but step one is to make sure we reform the system to have the system in place that leaves no child behind.
Stop this business about asking gosh, how old are you?
If you're 10 we'll put you here, 12 you put here.
Start asking the question, what do you know?
If you don't know what you're supposed to know, we'll make sure you do early before it's too late.
New question.
We've been talking about a lot of specific issues.
It's often said that in the final analysis about 90% of being the President of the United States is dealing with the unexpected, not with issues that came up in the campaign.
Vice President Gore, can you point to a decision, an action you have taken, that illustrates your ability to handle the unexpected, the crisis under fire?
When the action in Kosovo was dragging on and we were searching for a solution to the problem, our country had defeated the adversary on the battlefield without a single American life being lost in combat.
But the dictator Milosevic was hanging on.
I invited the former prime minister of Russia to my house and took a risk in asking him to get personally involved, along with the head of Finland, to go to Belgrade and to take a set of proposals from the United States that would constitute basically a surrender by Serbia.
But it was a calculated risk that paid off.
Now, I could probably give you some other examples of decisions over the last 24 years.
I have been in public service for 24 years, Jim.
And throughout all that time the people I have fought for have been the middle-class families, and I have been willing to stand up to powerful interests like the big insurance companies, the drug companies, the HMOs, the oil companies.
They have good people and they play constructive roles sometimes, but sometimes they get too much power.
I cast my lot with the people even when it means that you have to stand up to some powerful interests who are trying to turn the -- the policies and the laws to their advantage.
You can see it in this campaign.
The big drug companies support Governor Bush's prescription drug proposal.
They oppose mine because they don't want to get Medicare involved because they're afraid that Medicare will negotiate lower prices for seniors who currently pay the highest prices of all.
Governor Bush?
I've been standing up to big Hollywood, big trial lawyers.
Was â€“ what was the question?
It was about emergencies, wasn't it?
It was about -- okay.
You know, as governor, one of the things you have to deal with is catastrophe.
I can remember the fires that swept Parker County, Texas.
I remember the floods that swept our state.
I remember going down to Del Rio, Texas.
I have to pay the administration a compliment.
James Lee Witt of FEMA has done a really good job of working with governors during times of crisis.
But that's the time when you're tested not only -- it's the time to test your mettle, a time to test your heart when you see people whose lives have been turned upside down.
It broke my heart to go to the flood scene in Del Rio where a fellow and his family got completely uprooted.
The only thing I knew to do was to get aid as quickly as possible with state and federal help, and to put my arms around the man and his family and cry with them.
That's what governors do.
They are often on the front line of catastrophic situations.
New question.
There can be all kinds of crises, Governor.
A questions for you.
There could be a crisis, for instance, in the financial area, the stock market could take a tumble, there could be a failure of a major financial institution.
What is your general attitude toward government intervention in such events?
Well, it depends, obviously.
But what I would do first and foremost, is I would get in touch with the Federal Reserve Chairman, Alan Greenspan, to find out all the facts and all the circumstances.
I would have my Secretary of the Treasury be in touch with the financial centers not only here, but at home.
I would make sure that key members of Congress were called in to discuss the gravity of the situation.
And I would come up with a game plan to deal with it.
That's what governors end up doing.
We end up being problem solvers.
We come up with practical, common sense solutions for problems that we're confronted with.
In this case, in the case of a financial crisis, I would gather all the facts before I made the decision as to what the government ought or ought not to do.
Vice President Gore?
First I want to compliment the governor on his response to those fires and floods in Texas.
I accompanied James Lee Witt down to Texas when those fires broke out.
And FEMA has been a major flagship project of our reinventing government efforts.
And I agree, it works extremely well now.
On the international financial crises that come up, my friend, Bob Rubin, the former Secretary of Treasury is here, he's a close advisor to me and great friend in all respects.
I have had a chance to work with him and Alan Greenspan and others on the crisis following the collapse of the Mexican peso.
When the Asian financial crisis raised the risk of world-wide recession that could affect our economy, And now, of course, the euro's value has been dropping, but seems to be under control.
But it started for me in the last eight years when I had the honor of casting the tie-breaking vote to end the old economic plan here at home and put into place a new economic plan that has helped us to make some progress, 22 million new jobs, the greatest prosperity ever.
But it's not good enough.
My attitude is you ain't seen nothing yet.
We need to do more and better.
So, Governor, would you agree there is no basic difference here on intervening -- on federal government intervening in what might be seen by others to be a private financial crisis?
No, there's no difference on that.
There is a difference, though, as to what the economy has meant.
I think the economy has meant more for the Gore and Clinton folks than the Gore and Clinton folks have meant for the economy.
I think most of the economic growth that has taken place is a result of ingenuity and hard work and entrepreneurship and that's the role of goverment to encourage that.
In terms of in response to the question, no.
Can I comment on that?
You may.
You know, I think the American people deserve credit for the great economy that we have.
It's their ingenuity, I agree with that.
But you know, they were working pretty hard eight years ago.
And now they had ingenuity eight years ago.
The difference is we've got a new policy.
And instead of concentrating on tax cuts mostly for the wealthy, we want -- I want tax cuts for the middle-class families and I want to continue the prosperity and make sure that it enriches not just a few but all of our families.
We have gone from the biggest deficits to the biggest surpluses.
We have gone from a triple-dip recession during the previous 12 years to a tripling of the stock market.
Instead of a high unemployment, we have the lowest African-American and Latin American unemployment rates in history and 22 million new jobs.
It's not good enough.
Too many people have been left behind.
We have got to do much more.
The key is job training, education, investments in health care and education, environment, retirement security.
And incidentally, we have got to preserve Social Security.
I'm totally opposed to diverting one out of every six dollars out of the Social Security trust fund, as the Governor has proposed, into the stock market.
I want new incentives for savings and investment for the young couples who are working hard so they can save and invest on their own on top of Social Security, not at the expense of Social Security, as the governor proposes.
Two points.
One, a lot of folks are still waiting for that 1992 middle-class tax cut.
I remember the vice president saying, "Just give us a chance to get up there, we're going to make sure you get tax cuts."
It didn't happen.
Now he's having to say that again.
They've had their chance to deliver a tax cut to you.
Secondly, the surest way to bust this economy is to increase the role and size of the federal budget.
The Senate Budget Committee did a study of the vice president's expenditures.
It's been projected that they could conceivably bust the budget by $900 billion.
That means he'll either have to raise your taxes by $900 billion or go into the Social Security surplus for $900 billion.
This is a plan that is going to increase the bureaucracy by 20,000 people.
His targeted tax cut is so detailed, so much fine print that it is going to require numerous IRS agents.
We need somebody to simplify the code, to be fair, to continue prosperity by sharing some of the surplus with the people who pay the bills, particularly those at the bottom end of the economic ladder.
If I could respond, Jim.
What he's quoting is not the Senate Budget Commiitte, it is a partisan press release by the Republicans on the Senate Budget Committee that's not worth the government -- the taxpayer-paid paper that it's printed on.
Now, as for 20,000 new bureaucrats, as you call them, you know, the size of the federal government will go down in a Gore administration.
In the reinventing government program you just look at the numbers.
It is 300,000 people smaller today than it was eight years ago.
Now, the fact is you're going to have a hard time convincing folks that we were a whole lot better off eight years ago than we are today.
But that's not the question.
The question is, will we be better off four years from now than we are today?
And as for the surest way to threaten our prosperity, having a $1.9 trillion tax cut, almost half of which goes to the wealthy, and a $1 trillion Social Security privatization proposal is the surest way to put our budget into deficit â€“ raise interest rates and put our prosperity at risk.
I can't let the man continue with fuzzy math.
It is 1.3 trillion Mr. Vice President.
It will go to everybody who pays taxes.
I'm not going to be the kind of president that says you get tax relief and you don't.
I'm not going to be a picker and chooser.
What is fair is everybody who pays taxes ought to get relief.
I thought we cleared this up a while ago.
New question on Social Security.
Both of you have Social Security reform plans, so we could spend the rest of the evening and two or three other evenings talking about them in detail.
We won't do that.
But --
Suits me.
Many experts, including Federal Reserve Chairman Greenspan, Vice President Gore, say that it will be impossible for either of you, essentially, to keep the system viable on its own during the coming baby boomer retirement onslaught without either reducing benefits or increasing taxes.
You disagree?
I do disagree.
Because if we can keep our prosperity going, if we can continue balancing the budget and paying down the debt, then the strong economy keeps generating surpluses.
Here is my plan.
I will keep Social Security in a lockbox and that pays down the national debt.
And the interest savings I would put right back into Social Security.
That extends the life of Social Security for 55 years.
Now, I think that it's very important to understand that cutting benefits under Social Security means that people like Winifred Skinner from Des Moines, Iowa, who is here, would really have a much harder time.
Because there are millions of seniors who are living almost hand to mouth.
And you talk about cutting benefits.
I don't go along with it.
I am opposed to it.
I'm also opposed to a plan that diverts 1 out of every $6 away from the Social Security Trust Fund.
Social Security is a trust fund that pays the checks this year with the money that is paid into Social Security this year.
The governor wants to divert 1 out of every $6 off into the stock market, which means that he would drain a trillion dollars out of the Social Security Trust Fund in this generation over the next ten years, and Social Security under that approach would go bankrupt within this generation.
His leading advisor on this plan actually said that would be okay, because then the Social Security Trust Fund could start borrowing.
It would borrow up to $3 trillion.
Now, Social Security has never done that.
And I don't think it should do that.
I think it should stay in a lockbox, and I'll tell you this.
I will veto anything that takes money out of Social Security for privatization or anything else other than Social Security.
I thought it was interesting that on the two minutes he spent about a million-and-a-half on my plan, which means he doesn't want you to know what he's doing is loading up IOUs for future generations.
He puts no real assets into the Social Security system.
The revenues exceed the expenses in Social Security until the year 2015 which means all retirees are going to get the promises made.
For those of you who he wants to scare into the voting booth to vote for him, hear me loud and clear.
A promise made will be a promise kept.
You bet we want to allow younger workers to take some of their own money.
That's the difference of opinion.
The vice president thinks it's the government's money.
The payroll taxes are your money.
You ought to put it in prudent, safe investments so that $1 trillion over the next ten years grows to be $3 trillion.
The money stays within the Social Security system.
It's a part of the Social Security system.
He claims it will be out of Social Security.
It's your money, it's a part of your retirement benefit.
It's a fundamental difference between what we believe.
I want you to have your own asset that you can call your own.
That you can pass on from one generation to the next.
I want to get a better rate of return for your own money than the paltry 2% that the current Social Security Trust gets today.
Mr. Greenspan I thought missed an opportunity to say there's a third way, and that is to get a better rate of return on the Social Security monies coming into the trust.
There is $2.3 trillion of surplus that we can use to make sure that younger workers have a Social Security plan in the future.
If we're smart and if we trust workers and if we understand the power of the compounding rate of interest.
Here is the difference.
I give a new incentive for younger workers to save their own money and invest their own money, but not at the expense of Social Security, on top of Social Security.
My plan is Social Security plus.
The governor's plan is Social Security minus.
Your future benefits would be cut by the amount that's diverted into the stock market.
If you make bad investments, that's too bad.
But even before then the problem hits because the money contributed to Social Security this year is an entitlement.
That's how it works.
And the money is used to pay the benefits for seniors
