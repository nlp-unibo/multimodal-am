our troops as nation builders.
I believe the role of the military is to fight and win war and therefore prevent war from happening in the first place.
So I would take my responsibility seriously.
And it starts with making sure we rebuild our military power.
Morale in today's military is too low.
We're having trouble meeting recruiting goals.
We met the goals this year, but in the previous years we have not met recruiting goals.
Some of our troops are not well-equipped.
I believe we're overextended in too many places.
And therefore I want to rebuild the military power.
It starts with a billion dollar pay raise for the men and women who wear the uniform.
A billion dollars more than the president recently signed into law.
It's to make sure our troops are well-housed and well-equipped.
Bonus plans to keep some of our high-skilled folks in the services and a commander in chief who clearly sets the mission.
The mission is to fight and win war and therefore prevent war from happening in the first place.
Vice President Gore, one minute.
Let me tell you what Iâ€™ll do.
First of all Â I want to make it clear, our military is the strongest, best-trained, best-equipped, best-led fighting force in the world and in the history of the world.
Nobody should have any doubt about that, least of all our adversaries or potential adversaries.
If you entrust me with the presidency, I will do whatever is necessary in order to make sure our forces stay the strongest in the world.
In fact, in my ten-year budget proposal I've set aside more than twice as much for this purpose as Governor Bush has in his proposal.
Now, I think we should be reluctant to get involved in someplace in a foreign country.
But if our national security is at stake, if we have allies, if we've tried every other course, if we're sure military action will succeed, and if the costs are proportionate to the benefits, we should get involved.
Now, just because we don't want to get involved everywhere doesn't mean we should back off anywhere it comes up.
I disagree with the proposal that maybe only when oil supplies are at stake that our national security is at risk.
I think that there are situations like in Bosnia or Kosovo where there's a genocide, where our national security is at stake there.
I agree our military is the strongest in the world today, that's not the question.
The question is will it be the strongest in the years to come?
The warning signs are real.
Everywhere I go on the campaign trail I see moms and dads whose son or daughter may wear the uniform and they tell me about how discouraged their son or daughter may be.
A recent poll was taken among 1,000 enlisted personnel, as well as officers, over half of whom will leave the service when their time of enlistment is up.
The captains are leaving the service.
There is a problem.
And it's going to require a new commander in chief to rebuild the military power.
The other day I was honored to be flanked by Colin Powell and General Norman Schwartzkopf recently stood by me side and agreed with me.
They said even if we are the strongest if we donâ€™t do something if we don't have a clear vision of the military, if we don't stop extending our troops all around the world and nation building missions, then we're going to have a serious problem coming down the road, and I'm going to prevent that.
I'm going to rebuild our military power.
It's one of the major priorities of my administration.
Vice President Gore, how should the voters go about deciding which one of you is better suited to make the kinds of decisions, whether it's Milosevic or whatever, in the military and foreign policy area?
Well, they should look at our proposals and look at us as people and make up their own minds.
When I was a young man, I volunteered for the Army.
I served my country in Vietnam.
My father was a senator who strongly opposed the Vietnam War.
I went to college in this great city, and most of my peers felt against the war as I did.
But I went anyway because I knew if I didn't, somebody else in the small town of Carthage, Tennessee, would have to go in my place.
I served for eight years in the House of Representatives and I served on the Intelligence Committee, specialized in looking at arms control.
I served for eight years in the United States Senate and served on the Armed Services Committee.
For the last eight years I've served on the National Security Council, and when the conflict came up in Bosnia, I saw a genocide in the heart of Europe with the most violent war on the continent of Europe since World War II.
Look, that's where World War I started in the Balkans.
My uncle was a victim of poisonous gas there.
Millions of Americans saw the results of that conflict.
We have to be willing to make good, sound judgments.
Incidentally, I know the value of making sure our troops have the latest technology.
The governor has proposed skipping the next generation of weapons.
I think that's a big mistake, because I think we have to stay at the cutting edge.
Governor, how would you advise the voters to make the decision on this issue?
I think you've got to look at how one has handled responsibility in office.
Whether or not it's -- the same in domestic policy as well.
Whether or not you have the capacity to convince people to follow?
Whether or not one makes decisions based on sound principles or whether or not you rely upon polls and focus groups on how to decide what the course of action is.
We have too much polling and focus groups going on in Washington today.
We need decisions made on sound principles.
I've been the governor of a big state.
I think one of the hallmarks of my relationship in Austin, Texas, is that I've had the capacity to work with both Republicans and Democrats.
I think that's an important part of leadership.
I think what it means to build consensus.
I've shown I know how to do so.
Tonight in the audience there's one elected state senator who is a Democrat, a former state-wide officer who is a Democrat, a lot of Democrats who are here in the debate to -- because they want to show their support that shows I know how to lead.
And so the fundamental answer to your question, who can lead and who's shown the ability to get things done?
If I could say one thing.
We are way over three-and-a-half minutes.
Go ahead.
One of the key points in foreign policy and national security policy is the need to re-establish the old-fashioned principle that politics ought to stop at the water's edge.
When I was in the United States Congress, I worked with former President Reagan to modernize our strategic weaponry and to pursue arms control in a responsible way.
When I was in the United States Senate I worked with former President Bush, your father.
I was one of only a few Democrats in the Senate to support the Persian Gulf War.
I think bipartisanship is a national asset.
We have to find ways to reestablish it in foreign policy and national security policy.
Do you have a problem with that?
Yeah.
Why haven't they done it in seven years?
New subject.
New question.
Should the voters of this election, Vice President Gore, see this in the domestic area as a major choice between competing political philosophies?
Oh, absolutely.
This is a very important moment in the history of our country.
Look, we've got the biggest surpluses in all of American history.
The key question that has to be answered in this election is will we use that prosperity wisely in a way that benefits all of our people and doesn't go just to the few.
Almost half of all the tax cut benefits, as I said under Governor Bush's plan, go to the wealthiest 1%.
I think we have to make the right and responsible choices.
I think we have to invest in education, protecting the environment, health care, a prescription drug benefit that goes to all seniors, not just to the poor, under Medicare, not relying on HMOs and insurance companies.
I think that we have to help parents and strengthen families by dealing with the kind of inappropriate entertainment material that families are just heart sick that their children are exposed to.
I think we've got to have welfare reform taken to the next stage.
I think that we have got to balance the budget every single year, pay down the national debt and, in fact, under my proposal the national debt will be completely eliminated by the year 2012.
I think we need to put Medicare and Social Security in a lockbox.
The governor will not put Medicare in a lockbox.
I don't think it should be used as a piggy bank for other programs.
I think it needs to be moved out of the budget and protected.
I'll veto anything that takes money out of Social Security or Medicare for anything other than Social Security or Medicare.
Now, the priorities are just very different.
I'll give you a couple of examples.
For every new dollar that I propose for spending on health care, Governor Bush spends $3 for a tax cut for the wealthiest 1%.
Now, for every dollar that I propose to spend on education, he spends $5 on a tax cut for the wealthiest 1%.
Those are very clear differences.
Governor, one minute.
The man is practicing fuzzy math again.
There's differences.
Under Vice President Gore's plan, he is going to grow the federal government in the largest increase since Lyndon Baines Johnson in 1965.
We're talking about a massive government, folks.
We're talking about adding to or increasing 200 programs, 20,000 new bureaucrats.
Imagine how many IRS agents it is going to take to be able to figure out his targeted tax cut for the middle class that excludes 50 million Americans.
There is a huge difference in this campaign.
He says he's going to give you tax cuts.
50 million of you won't receive it.
He said in his speech he wants to make sure the right people get tax relief.
That's not the role of a president to decide right and wrong.
Everybody who pays taxes ought to get tax relief.
After my plan is in place, the wealthiest Americans will pay a higher percentage of taxes then they do today, the poorest of Americans, six million families, won't pay any tax at all.
It's a huge difference.
A difference between big exploding federal government that wants to think on your behalf and a plan that meets priorities and liberates working people to be able to make decisions on your own.
Let me just say, Jim, you haven't heard the governor deny these numbers.
He's called them phony and fuzzy.
The fact remains almost 30% of his proposed tax cut goes to -- only to Americans that make more than $1 million per year.
More money goes to the -- can I have a rebuttal here?
I want to see if he buys that.
Let me tell you what the facts are.
The facts are after my plan, the wealthiest of Americans pay more taxes of the percentage of the whole than they do today.
Secondly, if you're a family of four making $50,000 in Massachusetts, you get a 50% tax cut.
Let me give you one example.
The Strunk family in Allentown, Pennsylvania, I campaigned with them the other day.
They make $51,000 combined income, they pay about $3500 in taxes.
Under my plan, they get $1800 of tax relief.
Under Vice President Gore's plan, they get $145 of tax relief.
Now you tell me who stands on the side of the fence.
You ask the Strunks whose plan makes more sense.
There is a difference of opinion.
He would rather spend the family's $1800 and I would rather the Strunks spend their own money.
Do you see it that way Mr. Vice President?
No, I don't, and I'm not going to go to calling names on his facts.
I'm just gonna tell you what the real facts are.
The analysis that he's talking about leaves out more than half of the tax cuts that I have proposed.
And if you just add the numbers up, he still hasn't denied it, he spends more money on a tax cut for the wealthiest 1% than all his new proposals for prescription drugs, healthcare, education, and national defense combined.
Now those are the wrong priorities.
$665 billion over ten years for the wealthiest 1%.
As I said, almost 30% of it goes to Americans that make more than $1 million per year.
Every middle class family is eligible for a tax cut under my proposal.
Let me give you some specific examples.
I believe college tuition up to $10,000 per year ought to be tax deductible so middle-class families can choose to send their children to college.
I believe all senior citizens should be able to choose their own doctors and get prescription drugs from their own pharmacists with Medicare paying half the bill.
I believe parents ought to be able to make more choices need more public and charter school choice to send their kids always to a safe school.
We need to make education the number one priority in our country and treat teachers like the professionals that they are.
And that's why I have made it a number one priority in my budget, not a tax cut for the wealthy.
Let me talk about tax cuts one more time.
This is a man whose plan excludes 50 million Americans.
Not so.
Take for example the marriage penalty.
If you itemize your tax return, you get no marriage penalty relief.
He picks and chooses.
He decides who the right people are.
It's a fundamental difference of opinion.
I want my fellow Americans to hear one more time.
We'll spend $25 trillion -- we'll collect $25 trillion in revenue in the next 10 years and spend $21 trillion.
Surely we can send 5% back to you that pay the bills.
Thereâ€™s a problem wait.
I want to say something, Jim.
This man has been disparaging my plan with all this Washington fuzzy math.
I want you to hear a problem weâ€™ve got here in the USA.
If you're a single mother making $22,000 a year and you have two children, under this tax code, for every additional dollar you make, you pay a higher marginal rate on that dollar than someone making more than $200,000 a year, and that is not right.
My plan drops the rate from 15% to 10% and increases the child credit from $500 to $1,000 to make the code more fair for everybody, not just a few, not just a handful.
Everybody who pays taxes ought to get some relief.
Having cleared that up, we're going to a new question.
Education.
Governor Bush.
Both of you have promised dramatically to change -- to change dramatically public education in this country.
Of the public money spent on education, only 6% of that is federal money.
You want to change 100% of the public education with 6% of the money, is that possible?
We can make a huge difference by saying if you receive federal money we expect you to show results.
Let me give you a story about public education, if I might.
It's about Kipp Academy in Houston, Texas.
A charter school run by some people from Teach For America.
Young folks saying I'm going to do something good for my country.
I want to teach.
A guy named Michael runs the school.
It is a school full of so-called at-risk children.
It's how we unfortunately label certain children.
Basically it means they can't learn.
It's a school of strong discipline and high standards.
It's one of the best schools in Houston.
Here are the key ingredients.
High expectations, strong accountabily.
What Michael says, don't put all these rules on us, just let us teach and hold us accountable for every grade.
That's what we do.
And as a result, these mainly Hispanic youngsters are some of the best learners in Houston, Texas.
That's my vision for public education all around America.
Many of you viewers don't know, but Laura and I sent our girls to public school.
They went to Austin High School.
And many of the public schools are meeting the call.
But, unfortunately, a lot of schools are trapping children in schools that just won't teach and won't change.
Here is the role of the federal government.
One is to change Head Start to a reading program.
Two is to say if you want to access reading money, you can do so.
The goal is for every single child to learn to Read.
there must by K-2 diagnostic teaching tools, teacher training money, available.
Three, we have to consolidate the federal programs to free districts to free the schools and encourage innovators like Michael.
Let them reach out beyond the confines of the current structure to recruit teach-for-the-children type teachers.
Four, we're going to say if you receive federal money, measure third, fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh and eighth grade.
Show us if they are learning to read, write, add and subtract and if so there will be bonus plans.
But if not, instead of continuing to subsidize failure, the money will go to -- the federal money will go to the parents for public school or charter school or tutorial or Catholic school.
What I care about is children.
And so does Michael Feinberg.
And you know what?
It can happen in America with the right kind of leadership.
We agree on a couple of things on education.
I strongly support new accountability, so does Governor Bush.
I strongly support local control, so does Governor Bush.
I'm in favor of testing as a way of measuring performance.
Every school and every school district, have every state test the children.
I've also proposed a voluntary national test in the fourth grade and eighth grade, and a form of testing the governor has not endorsed.
I think that all new teachers ought to be tested in the subjects that they teach.
We've got to recruit 100,000 new teachers.
And I have budgeted for that.
We've got to reduce the class size so that the student who walks in has more one-on-one time with the teacher.
We ought to have universal pre-school and we ought to make college tuition tax deductible, up to $10,000 a year.
I would like to tell you a quick story.
I got a letter today as I left Sarasota, Florida.
I'm here with a group of 13 people from around the country who helped me prepare.
We had a great time.
Two days ago we ate lunch at a restaurant.
The guy that served us lunch gave me a letter today.
His name is Randy Ellis.
He has a 15-year-old daughter named Caley, who is in Sarasota High School.
Her science class was supposed to be for 24 students.
She's the 36th student in that classroom.
They sent me a picture of her in the classroom.
They can't squeeze another desk in for her, so she has to stand during class.
I want the federal government, consistent with local control and new accountability, to make improvement of our schools the number one priority so Caley will have a desk and can sit down in a classroom where she can learn.
All right.
So having heard the two of you, the voters have just heard the two of you, what is the difference?
What is the choice between the two of you on education?
The first is, the difference is there is no new accountability measures in Vice President Gore's plan.
He says he's for voluntary testing.
You can't have voluntary testing.
You must have mandatory testing.
You must say that if you receive money you must show us whether or not children are learning to read and write and add and subtract.
That's the difference.
You may claim you've got mandatory testing but you don't, Mr. Vice President.
That's a huge difference.
Testing is the cornerstone of reform.
You know how I know?
Because it's the cornerstone of reform in the State of Texas.
Republicans and
