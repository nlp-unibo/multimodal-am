on working on the consumption side.
Now, in the short-term we have to free ourselves from the domination of the big oil companies that have the ability to manipulate the price from OPEC when they want to raise the price.
And in the long-term we have to give new incentives for the development of domestic resources like deep gas in the western Gulf, like stripper wells for oil, but also renewable sources of energy.
And domestic sources that are cleaner and better.
And I'm proposing a plan that will give tax credits and tax incentives for the rapid development of new kinds of cars and trucks and buses and factories and boilers and furnaces that don't have as much pollution, that don't burn as much energy, and that help us get out on the cutting edge of the new technologies that will create millions of new jobs.
Because, when we sell these new products here, we'll then be able to sell them overseas.
There is a ravenous demand for them overseas.
Now, another big difference is Governor Bush is proposing to open up some of our most precious environmental treasures, like the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge for the big oil companies to go in and start producing oil there.
I think that is the wrong choice.
It would only give us a few months' worth of oil and the oil wouldn't start flowing for many years into the future.
I don't think it's a fair price to pay to destroy precious parts of America's environment.
We have to bet on the future and move beyond the current technologies to have a whole new generation of more efficient, cleaner, energy technology.
It's an issue I know a lot about.
I was a small oil person for a while in west Texas.
This is an administration that's had no plan.
And all of a sudden the results of having no plan have caught up with America.
First and foremost we have to fully fund LIHEAP which is a way to help low income folks, particularly here in the east to pay for high fuel bills.
Secondly, we need an active exploration program in America.
The only way to become less dependent on foreign sources of crude oil is to explore at home.
You bet I want to open up a small part of Alaska.
When that field is online it will produce one million barrels a day.
Today we import one million barrels from Saddam Hussein.
I would rather that a million come from our own hemisphere, our own country as opposed to Saddam Hussein.
I want to build more pipelines to move natural gas throughout this hemisphere.
I want to develop the coal resources in America.
Have clean coal technologies.
Weâ€™ve got abundant supplies of energy here in America and weâ€™d better get after it, we better start exploring it or otherwise we'll be in deep trouble in the future because of our dependency upon foreign sources of crude.
So if somebody is watching tonight and listening to what the two of you just said, is it fair to say, okay, the differences between Governor Bush and Vice President Gore are as follows.
You're for doing something on the consumption end and you're for doing something on the production end?
Let me clarify.
I'm for doing something both on the supply side and production side and on the consumption side.
Let me say, that I found one thing in Governor Bush's answer that we certainly agree on, and that's the low income heating assistance program.
I commend you for supporting that.
I worked to get $400 million just a couple of weeks ago.
And to establish a permanent home heating oil reserve here in the northeast.
Now, as for the proposals that I've worked for for renewables and conservation and efficiencies and new technologies.
The fact is for the last few years in the Congress, we've faced a lot of opposition to them.
They've only approved about 10% of the agenda I've helped to send up there.
I think we need to get serious about this energy crisis, both in the Congress and in the White House, and if you entrust me with the presidency, I will tackle this problem and focus on new technologies that will make us less dependent on big oil or foreign oil.
How would you draw the difference?
Well I would first say he should have been tackling it for the last seven years.
Secondly the difference is we need to explore at home.
And the vice president doesn't believe in exploration in Alaska.
There's a lot of shut-in gas that we need to be moving out of Alaska by pipeline.
There's an interesting issue up in the northwest as well.
Do we remove dams that produce hydroelectric energy?
I'm against removing dams in the northwest.
I donâ€™t know where the vice president stands but thatâ€™s a renewable energy source of energy.
We need to keep that in line.
I was in coal country in West Virginia yesterday.
There is an abundant supply of coal in America.
I know we can do a better job of clean coal technologies.
I'm going to ask the Congress for $2 billion to make sure we have the cleanest coal technologies in the world.
My answer to you is in the short-term we need to get after it here in America.
We need to explore our resources and we need to develop our reservoirs of domestic production.
We also need to have a hemispheric energy policy where Canada, Mexico and the United States come together.
I brought this up recently with Vincent Fox the newly elected president in Mexico, he's a man I know from Mexico.
I talked to him about how best to expedite the exploration of natural gas in Mexico and transport it up to the United States so we become less dependent on foreign sources of crude oil.
This is a major problem facing America.
The administration did not deal with it.
It's time for a new administration to deal with the energy problem.
If I may just briefly, Jim, note.
I found a couple of other things we agree upon.
We may not find that many this evening, so I wanted to emphasize.
I strongly support new investments in clean coal technology.
I made a proposal three months ago on this.
And also domestic exploration yes, but not in the environmental treasures of our country.
We don't have to do that.
That's the wrong choice.
I know the oil companies have been itching to do that, but it is not the right thing for the future.
No.
It's the right thing for the consumers.
Less dependency upon foreign sources of crude is good for consumers.
And we can do so in an environmentally friendly way.
Well can I have the last word on this?
New question, new subject.
Governor Bush.
If elected president, would you try to overturn the FDA's approval last week of the abortion pill RU-486?
I don't think a president can do that.
I was disappointed in the ruling because I think abortions ought to be more rare in America, and I'm worried that that pill will create more abortions and cause more people to have abortions.
This is a very important topic and it's a very sensitive topic, because a lot of good people disagree on the issue.
I think what the next president ought to do is to promote a culture of life in America.
Life of the elderly and life of those living all across the country.
Life of the unborn.
As a matter of fact, I think a noble goal for this country is that every child, born or unborn, need to be protected by law and welcomed to life.
I know we need to change a lot of minds before we get there in America.
What I do believe is that we can find good, common ground on issues of parental consent or parental notification.
I know we need to ban partial birth abortions.
This is a place where my opponent and I have strong disagreement.
I believe banning partial birth abortions would be a positive step to reducing the number of abortions in America.
This is an issue that will require a new attitude.
We've been battling over abortion for a long period of time.
Surely this nation can come together to promote the value of life.
Surely we can fight off these laws that will encourage doctors to -- to allow doctors to take the lives of our seniors.
Surely we can work together to create a cultural life so some of these youngsters who feel like they can take a neighbor's life with a gun will understand that that's not the way America is meant to be.
Surely we can find common ground to reduce the number of abortions in America.
As to the drug itself, I mentioned I was disappointed.
I hope the FDA took its time to make sure that American women will be safe who use this drug.
Vice President Gore?
Well, Jim, the FDA took 12 years, and I do support that decision.
They determined it was medically safe for the women who use that drug.
This is indeed a very important issue.
First of all on the issue of partial birth or so-called late-term abortion, I would sign a law banning that procedure, provided that doctors have the ability to save a woman's life or to act if her health is severely at risk.
That's not the main issue.
The main issue is whether or not the Roe v. Wade decision is going to be overturned.
I support a woman's right to choose.
My opponent does not.
It is important because the next president is going to appoint three and maybe even four justices of the Supreme Court.
And Governor Bush has declared to the anti-choice groups that he will appoint justices in the mold of Scalia and Clarence Thomas, who are known for being the most vigorous opponents of a woman's right to choose.
Here is the difference.
He trusts the government to order a woman to do what it thinks she ought to do.
I trust women to make the decisions that affect their lives, their destinies and their bodies.
And I think a woman's right to choose ought to be protected and defended.
Governor, we'll go to the Supreme Court question in a moment, but make sure I understand your position on RU-486.
If you're elected president, not through appointments to the FDA, you won't support legislation to overturn this?
I don't think a president can unilaterally overturn it.
The FDA has made its decision.
That means you wouldn't, through appointments, to the FDA and ask them to --
I think once a decision has been made, it's been made unless it's proven to be unsafe to women.
Jim, the question you asked, if I heard you correctly, was would he support legislation to overturn it.
And if I heard the statement day before yesterday, you said you would order -- he said he would order his FDA appointee to review the decision.
Now that sounds to me a little bit different.
I just think that we ought to support the decision.
I said I would make sure that women would be safe who used the drug.
On the Supreme Court question.
Should a voter assume -- you're pro-life.
I am pro-life.
Should a voter assume that all judicial appointments you make to the supreme court or any other court, federal court, will also be pro-life?
The voters should assume I have no litmus test on that issue or any other issue.
Voters will know I'll put competent judges on the bench.
People who will strictly interpret the Constitution and not use the bench to write social policy.
That is going to be a big difference between my opponent and me.
I believe that the judges ought not to take the place of the legislative branch of government.
That they're appointed for life and that they ought to look at the Constitution as sacred.
They shouldn't misuse their bench.
I don't believe in liberal activist judges.
I believe in strict constructionists.
Those are the kind of judges I will appoint.
I've named four supreme court justices in the State of Texas and would ask the people to check out their qualifications, their deliberations.
They're good, solid men and women who have made good, sound judgments on behalf of the people of Texas.
What kind of appointments should they expect from you?
We both use similar language to reach an exactly opposite outcome.
I don't favor a litmus test, but I know that there are ways to assess how a potential justice interprets the Constitution.
And in my view, the Constitution ought to be interpreted as a document that grows with our country and our history.
And I believe, for example, that there is a right of privacy in the Fourth Amendment.
And when the phrase a strict constructionist is used and when the names of Scalia and Thomas are used as the benchmarks for who would be appointed, those are code words, and nobody should mistake this, for saying the governor would appoint people who would overturn Roe v. Wade.
It's very clear to me.
I would appoint people that have a philosophy that I think would have it quite likely they would uphold Roe v. Wade.
Is the vice president right?
Is that a code word for overturning Roe v. Wade?
It sounds like the vice presidentâ€™s not right very many times tonight.
I just told you the criteria on which I'll appoint judges.
I have a record of appointing judges in the State of Texas.
That's what a governor gets to do.
A governor gets to name supreme court judges.
He also reads all kinds of things into my tax plan and into my Medicare plan.
I want the viewers out there to listen to what I have to say about it.
Reverse the question.
What code phrases should we read by what you said about what kind of people you would appoint?
It would be likely that they would uphold Roe v. Wade.
I do believe it's wrong to use a litmus test.
If you look at the history of a lower court judge's rulings, you can get a pretty good idea of how they'll interpret questions.
A lot of questions are first impression, and these questions that have been seen many times come up in a new context and so -- but, you know, this is a very important issue.
Because a lot of young women in this country take this right for granted and it could be lost.
It is on the ballot in this election, make no mistake about it.
I'll tell you what kind of judges he'll put on.
He'll put liberal activists justices who will use their bench to subvert the legislature, that's what he'll do.
Thatâ€™s not right.
New subject, new question.
Vice President Gore, if President Milosevic of Yugoslavia refuses to accept the election results and leave office, what action, if any, should the United States take to get him out of there?
Well, Milosevic has lost the election.
His opponent, Kostunica, has won the election.
It's overwhelming.
Milosevic's government refuses to release the vote count.
There's now a general strike going on.
They're demonstrating.
I think we should support the people of Serbia and Yugoslavia, as they call the Serbia plus Montenegro, and put pressure in every way possible to recognize the lawful outcome of the election.
The people of Serbia have acted very bravely in kicking this guy out of office.
Now he is trying to not release the votes and then go straight to a so-called runoff election without even announcing the results of the first vote.
Now, we've made it clear, along with our allies, that when Milosevic leaves, then Serbia will be able to have a more normal relationship with the rest of the world.
That is a very strong incentive that we've given them to do the right thing.
Bear in mind also, Milosevic has been indicted as a war criminal and he should be held accountable for his actions.
Now, we have to take measured steps because the sentiment within Serbia is, for understandable reasons, against the United States because their nationalism -- even if they don't like Milosevic, they still have some feelings lingering from the NATO action there.
So we have to be intelligent in the way we go about it.
But make no mistake about it, we should do everything we can to see that the will of the Serbian people expressed in this extraordinary election is done.
And I hope that he'll be out of office very shortly.
Governor Bush, one minute.
Well, I'm pleased with the results of the election.
As the vice president is.
It's time for the man to go.
It means that the United States must have a strong diplomatic hand with our friends in NATO.
That's why it's important to make sure our alliances are as strong as they possibly can be to keep the pressure on Mr. Milosevic.
But this will be an interesting moment for the Russians to step up and lead as well.
Be a wonderful time for the Russians to step into the Balkans and convince Mr. Milosevic that it's in his best interest and his country's best interest to leave office.
The Russians have a lot of sway in that part of the world.
We would like to see the Russians use that sway to encourage democracy to take hold.
It's an encouraging election.
It's time for the man to leave.
What if he doesn't leave?
What if all the diplomatic efforts, all the pressure from all over the world and he still doesn't go?
Is this the kind of thing, to be specific, that you as president would consider the use of U.S. military force to get him gone?
In this particular situation, no.
Bear in mind that we have a lot of sanctions in force against Serbia right now.
And the people of Serbia know that they can escape all those sanctions if this guy is turned out of power.
Now, I understand what the governor has said about asking the Russians to be involved, and under some circumstances that might be a good idea.
But being as they have not yet been willing to recognize Kostunica as the lawful winner of the election, I'm not sure it's right for us to invite the president of Russia to mediate this -- this dispute there because we might not like the results that comes out of that.
They currently favor going forward with a runoff election.
I think that's the wrong thing.
I think the governor's instinct is not necessarily bad because we have worked with the Russians in a constructive way in Kosovo, for example, to end the conflict there.
But I think we need to be very careful in the present situation before we invite the Russians to play the lead role in mediating.
Well obviously we wouldn't use the Russians if they didn't agree with our answer, Mr. Vice President.
They donâ€™t.
Let me say this to you, I wouldn't use force.
I wouldn't use force.
You wouldn't use force?
No.
Why not?
It's not in our national interest to use force in this case.
I would use pressure and diplomacy.
There is a difference with what the president did in Kosovo which I supported and this.
It's up to the people in this region to take control of their country.
New question.
How would you go about as president deciding when it was in the national interest to use U.S. force, generally?
Well, if it's in our vital national interests, and that means whether our territory is threatened or people could be harmed, whether or not the alliances are -- our defense alliances are threatened, whether or not our friends in the Middle East are threatened.
That would be a time to seriously consider the use of force.
Secondly, whether or not the mission was clear.
Whether or not it was a clear understanding as to what the mission would be.
Thirdly, whether or not we were prepared and trained to win.
Whether or not our forces were of high morale and high standing and well-equipped.
And finally, whether or not there was an exit strategy.
I would take the use of force very seriously.
I would be guarded in my approach.
I don't think we can be all things to all people in the world.
I think we've got to be very careful when we commit our troops.
The vice president and I have a disagreement about the use of troops.
He believes in nation building.
I would be very careful about using
