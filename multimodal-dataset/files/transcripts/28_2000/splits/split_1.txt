These folks submitted 18 questions on education, and the first one is that will be asked on education will go to you, Governor, and asked by Angie Pettig.
Angie Pettig, where are you?
There she is, Governor, right there.
I've heard a lot about education and the need to hold teachers and schools accountable, and I certainly agree with that.
But as an individual with an educational background, and also a parent, I have seen a lot of instances where the parents are unresponsive to the teachers or flat out uninvolved in their child's education.
How do you intend to not only hold the teachers and schools accountable but also hold parents accountable?
Well, you know, it's hard to make people love one another.
I wish I knew the law because I would darn sure sign it.
I wish I knew the law that said all of us would be good parents.
One of the things the next president must do is to remind people that if we are going to have a responsible period in America, that each of us must love our children with all our heart and all our soul.
I happened to believe strong accountability encourages parental involvement, though.
I think when you measure and post results on the Internet or in the town newspapers, most parents say wait a minute, my child's school isn't doing what I want it to do and, therefore, become involved in education.
I recognize there are some who just don't seem to care.
But there are a lot of parents who feel like everything is going well in their child's school, and all of a sudden they wake up and realize that wait a minute, standards aren't being met.
That's why I'm so strong for accountability.
I believe we ought to measure a lot, three, four, five, six, seven, eighth grade.
We do so in my state of Texas.
One of the good things we've gone in Texas is we have strong accountability because you can't cure unless you know.
You can't solve a problem unless you diagnose it.
I strongly believe that one of the best things to encourage parental involvement also is to know that the classrooms will be safe and secure.
That's why I support a teacher liability act at the federal level, that says if a teacher or principal upholds reasonable standards of classroom discipline they can't be sued.
They can't be sued.
I think parents will be more involved with education when they know their children's classrooms are safe and secure as well.
I also believe that we need to say to people that if you cannot meet standards, there has to be a consequence.
Instead of just comes the soft bigotry of low expectations, that there has to be a consequence.
We can't continue to shuffle children through school.
And one of the consequences to allow parents to have different choices.
Governor.
Vice president Gore.
We have huge difference between us on this question.
I'd like to start by telling you what my vision is.
I see a day in the United States of America where all of our public schools are considered excellent, world class.
Where there are no failing schools, where the classrooms are small enough in size, number of students, so that the teacher can spend enough one-on-one time with each student.
Now that means recruiting new teachers for the public schools.
It means in my plan hiring bonuses to get 100,000 new teachers in the public schools within the next four years.
It means also helping local school districts that sometimes find the parents of school age children outvoted on bond issues, to give them some help with interest-free bonding authority so that we can build new schools and modernize the classrooms.
We need to give teachers the training and professional development that they need, including a paid time off to go visit the classroom of a master teacher to pick up some new skills.
I want to give every middle-class family a $10,000 a year tax deduction for college tuition so that middle-class families will always be able to send their kids on to college.
I want to work for universal free school because we know from all the studies that the youngsters learn, kids learn more in the first few years of life than any where else.
Now, I said there was a contrast.
Governor Bush is for vouchers, and in his plan he proposes to drain more money, more taxpayer money out of the public schools for private school vouchers than all of the money that he proposes in his entire budget for public schools themselves.
And only one in 20 students would be eligible for these vouchers, and they wouldn't even pay the full tuition to private school.
I think that's a mistake.
I don't think we should give up on the private schools and leave kids trapped in failing schools.
I think we -- I think we should make it the number one priority to make our schools the best in the world, all of them.
Governor, what is your position on that?
Yeah, I appreciate that.
I think any time we end with one of these attacks, it's appropriate to respond.
Here's what I think.
First of all, vouchers are up to states.
If you want to do a voucher program in Missouri, fine.
I strongly believe in local control of schools.
I'm a governor of state and I don't like it when the federal government tells us what to do.
I believe in local control of schools.
But here's what I said.
I've said to the extent we spend federal money on disadvantaged children, we want the schools to show us whether or not the children are learning.
What's unreasonable about that?
We expect there to be standards met and we expect there to be measurement.
And if we find success we'll praise it.
But when we find children trapped in schools that will not change and will not teach, instead of saying oh, this is okay in America just to shuffle poor kids through schools, there has to be a consequence.
And the consequence is that federal portion or federal money will go to the parent, so the parent can go to a tutoring program or another public school or another private school.
You see, there has to be a consequence.
We've got a society that says hey, the status quo is fine, just move them through.
And guess who suffers.
What's the harm on that, what's the other side on that?
Well, the program that he's proposing is not the one that he just described.
Described under your plan, Governor Bush, states would be required to pay vouchers to students to match the vouchers so that the federal government would put up.
Now, you're -- and the way it would happen is that under his plan, if a school was designated as failing, the kids would be trapped there for another three years and then some of them would get federal vouchers and the state would be forced to match those, that money.
Under my plan, if a school is failing, we work with the states to give them the authority and the resources to close down that school and reopen it right away with a new principal, a new faculty, a turn-around team of specialists who know what they're doing.
It's based on the plan of Governor Jim Hunt in North Carolina, and it works great.
So no vouchers under -- in a Gore administration?
If I thought that there was no alternative, then I might feel differently.
But I have an obligation to fight to make sure there are no failing schools.
We have to turn around -- most schools are excellent, but we have to make sure that all of them are.
Andrew Kosberg has a related question on education that's right on this subject.
Mr. Kosberg, where are you?
And it's for Vice President Gore.
Mr. Vice President, in a school district in which I work and in countless others across the nation, we face crumbling school buildings, increased school violence, student apathy, overcrowding, lack of funding, lawsuits, the list goes on.
I could mention low teacher pay but I won't.
What can you tell me and my fellow American teachers today about your plans for our immediate future?
What grade do you teach?
That's a violation of your rule, Vice President Gore.
High school.
I mentioned before that the local communities are having a harder time passing bond issues.
Traditionally, if you've been involved in a campaign like that, you know that the parents with kids in school are the ones that turn out and vote.
It's ironic that there are now -- there is now a smaller percentage of the voters made up of parents with children than ever in American history because of the aging of our population, but at the same time we've got the largest generation of students in public schools ever.
More than 90% of America's children go to public schools.
And it's the largest number ever this year and they'll break the record next year and every year for ten years running.
We've got to do something about this.
And local -- it's not enough to leave it up to the local school districts.
They're not able to do it and our future depends upon it.
Look, we're in an information age.
Our economic future depends upon whether or not our children are going to get the kind of education that lets them go on to college.
And again, I want to make it possible for all middle-class families to send their kids to college and more Pell grants for those who are in the lower income groups also, and then I want to make sure that we have job training on top of that and lifelong learning, but it all starts with the public school teachers.
My proposal gives $10,000 hiring bonuses for those teachers who are -- who get certified to teach in the areas where they're most needed.
Now, accountability, we basically agree on accountability.
My plan requires testing of all students.
It also requires something that Governor Bush's plan doesn't.
It requires testing of all new teachers, including in the subjects that they teach.
We have to start treating teachers like the professionals that they are, and give them the respect and the kind of quality of life that will draw more people into teaching because we need a lot more teachers.
Governor Bush, two minutes.
When you total up all the federal spending he wants to do, it's the largest increase in federal spending in years.
And there's just not going to be enough money.
I have been a governor of a big state, I have made education my number one priority.
That's what governors ought to do.
They ought to say this is the most important thing we do as a state.
The federal government puts about 6% of the money up.
They put about, you know, 60% of the strings where you have to fill out the paperwork.
I don't know if you have to be a paperwork filler-outer, but most of it's because of the federal government.
What I want to do is to send flexibility and authority to the local folks so you can choose what to do with the money.
One size does not fit all.
I worry about federalizing education if I were you.
I believe strongly that the federal government can help, we need to fund Headstart.
We need to have accountability.
The Vice President's plan does not have annual accountability, third grade, fourth grade, fifth grade.
We need to demand on results.
I believe strongly in a teacher protection act like I mentioned.
I hear from teachers all the time about the lawsuits and the threats, respect in the classroom.
Part of it's because you can't -- you can't control the classroom.
You can't have a consequence for somebody without fear of getting sued under federal law.
So I'm going to ask the Congress to pass a teacher protection act.
So I believe in flexibility, I believe in a national reading initiative for local districts to access with K through 2 diagnostic testing, curriculum that works, phonics works, by the way, it needs to be a part of our curriculum.
There needs to be flexibility for teacher training and teacher hiring with federal money.
The federal government can be a part, but don't fall prey to all this stuff about money here and money there because education is really funded at the local level.
94% comes from the local level.
Vice President Gore, is the governor right when he says that you're proposing the largest federal spending in years?
Absolutely not.
Absolutely not.
I'm so glad that I have the chance to knock that down.
Look, the problem is that under Governor Bush's plan, $1.6 trillion tax cut, mostly to the wealthy, under his own budget numbers, he proposes spending more money for a tax cut just for the wealthiest 1% than all the new money he budgets for education, health care and national defense combined.
Now under my plan we'll balance the budget every year.
I'm not just saying this.
I'm not just talking.
I have helped to balance the budget for the first time in 30 years, paid down the debt.
And under my plan, in four years, as the percentage of our gross domestic product, federal spending will be the smallest that it has been in 50 years.
One reason is, you know, the third biggest spending item in our budget is interest on the national debt?
We get nothing for it.
We keep the good faith and credit of the United States.
I will pay down the debt every single year until it is eliminated early in the next decade.
That gets rid of the third biggest intrusion of the federal government in our economy.
Now, because the governor has all this money for a tax cut mostly to the wealthy, there is no money left over, so schools get testing and lawsuit reform and not much else.
Governor, the vice president says you're wrong.
Well, he's wrong.
(LAUGHTER) Just add up all the numbers.
It's three times bigger than what President Clinton proposed.
The Senate Budget Committee --
Three times -- excuse me, three times bigger than what President Clinton proposed?
That was in an ad, Jim, that was knocked down by the journalists who analyzed the ad and said it was misleading.
My turn?
Yes, sir.
Forget the journalists.
He proposed more than Walter Mondale and Michael Dukakis combined.
This is a big spender.
And he ought to be proud of it, it's part of his record.
We just have a different philosophy.
Let me talk about tax relief.
If you pay taxes, you ought to get tax relief.
The Vice President believes only the right people ought to get tax relief.
I don't think that's the role of the president to pick you're right and you're not right.
I think if you're going to have tax relief, everybody ought to get it.
And therefore, wealthy people are going to get it.
But the top 1% will end up paying one-third of the taxes in America and they get one-fifth of the benefits.
And that's because we structured the plan so that six million additional American families pay no taxes.
If you're a family of four making $50,000 in Missouri, you get a 50% cut in your federal income taxes.
What I've done is set priorities and funded them.
And there's extra money.
And I believe the people who pay the bills ought to get some money back.
It's a difference of opinion.
He wants to grow the government and I trust you with your own money.
I wish we could spend an hour talking about trusting people.
It's just the right position to take.
Can we take the time --
Governor -- yeah, hold on one second here, thought.
The governor just reversed the thing.
What do you say specifically to what the vice president said tonight, he said it many, many times, that your tax cut benefits the top 1% of the wealthiest Americans, and you've heard what he said.
Of course it does.
If you pay taxes, you are going to get a benefit.
People who pay taxes will get tax relief.
All right.
Why shouldn't they?
Let me finish.
Under my plan, if you make -- the top -- the wealthy people pay 62% of the taxes today.
Afterwards they pay 64%.
This is a fair plan.
You know why?
Because the tax code is unfair for people at the bottom end of the economic ladder.
If you're a single mother making $22,000 a year today and you're trying to raise two children, for every additional dollar you earn you pay a higher marginal rate on that dollar than someone making $200,000, and that's not right.
So I want to do something about that.
Vice President Gore?
Yeah, look.
Look, this isn't about Governor Bush, it's not about me.
It is about you.
And I want to come back to something I said before.
If you want somebody who believes that we were better off eight years ago than we are now and that we ought to go back to the kind of policies that we had back then, emphasizing tax cuts mainly for the wealthy, here is your man.
If you want somebody who will fight for you and who will fight to have middle-class tax cuts, then I am your man.
I want to be.
Now, I doubt anybody here makes more than $330,000 a year.
I won't ask you, but if you do, you're in the top 1%.
It would be a violation of the rules.
They couldn't --
I'm not going to ask them.
But if everyone here in this audience was dead on in the middle of the middle-class, then the tax cuts for every single one of you all added up would be less than the tax cut his plan would give to just one member of that top wealthiest 1%.
Now you judge for yourselves whether or not that's fair.
Quick, and then we're moving on.
Good.
50 million Americans get no tax relief under his plan.
That's not right.
You may not be one of them, you're just not one of the right people.
And secondly, we've had enough fighting.
It's time to unite.
You talk about eight years?
In eight years they haven't gotten anything done on Medicare, on Social Security, a patient's bill of rights.
It's time to get something done.
Hey, I've got to answer that, Jim.
All right.
Medicare -- I cast the tie-breaking vote to add 26 years to the life of Medicare.
It was due to go bankrupt in 1999 and that 50 million figure again, the newspapers -- I said -- you said forget the journalists, but they are the keepers of the score card and whether or not you're using facts that aren't right.
And that fact is just not right.
Speaking of keepers of the score card, that's what I'm trying to do here Mr. Vice President and Governor Bush.
We're gonna move on.
We're gonna have to move on.
All right, there were 12 questions on foreign and military matters, and the first one that we're going to ask will be directed to you, Governor Bush.
And David Norwood is going to ask it.
Mr. Norwood, where are you?
There you are.
What would you make -- what would make you the best candidate in office during the Middle East crisis?
I've been a leader.
I've been a person who has to set a clear vision and convince people to follow.
I've got a strategy for the Middle East.
And first let me say that our nation now needs to speak with one voice during this time, and I applaud the president for working hard to diffuse tensions.
Our nation needs to be credible and strong.
When we say we're somebody's friend, everybody has got to believe it.
Israel is our friend and we'll stand by Israel.
We need to reach out to moderate Arab nations as well to build coalitions to keep the peace.
I also need -- the next leader needs to be patient.
We can't put the Middle East peace process on our timetable.
It's got to be on the timetable of the people that we're trying to bring to the peace table.
