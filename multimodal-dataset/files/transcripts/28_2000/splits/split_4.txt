things like DNA evidence, which I think should be used in all capital cases, but also with very careful attention.
If, for example, somebody confesses to the crime and somebody is waiting on death row, there has to be alertness to say wait a minute, have we got the wrong guy?
If the wrong guy is put to death, then that's a double tragedy.
Not only has an innocent person been executed, but the real perpetrator of the crime has not been held accountable for it.
And in some cases may be still at large.
But I support the death penalty in the most heinous cases.
Do both of you believe the death penalty actually deters crime?
Governor?
I do.
It's the only reason to be for it.
Let me finish, sir.
I don't think you should support the death penalty to seek revenge.
I don't think that's right.
I think the reason to support the death penalty is because it saves other people's lives.
I think it is a deterrent.
I know that's a controversial view, but I do believe it's a deterrent.
Next question is for you, Vice President Gore, and Thomas Fischer will ask it.
Mr. Fischer?
Yes.
My 6th grade class at St. Claire's School wanted to ask of all these promises you guys are making and all the pledges, will you keep them when you're in office?
(LAUGHTER)
Yes.
(LAUGHTER) I am a person who keeps promises.
And, you know, we've heard a lot about -- from the governor about not much being done in the last eight years, as if the promises that I made eight years ago have not been kept.
I think the record shows otherwise.
We have gone from the biggest deficits eight years ago to the biggest surpluses in history today.
Instead of high unemployment, we now have the lowest African-American unemployment, the lowest Latino unemployment ever measured.
22 million new jobs, very low unemployment nationally.
Instead of ballooning the debt and multiplying it four times over, we have seen the debt actually begun to be paid down.
Here are some promises that I'll make to you now.
I will balance the budget every year.
I will pay down the debt every year.
I will give middle-class Americans tax cuts, meaningful ones.
And I will invest in education, health care, protecting the environment and retirement security.
We both made promises in this campaign.
I promise you I will keep mine.
Let me tell you about one of the governor's.
He has promised a trillion dollars out of the Social Security Trust Fund for young working adults to invest and save on their own.
But he's promised seniors that their Social Security benefits will not be cut, and he's promised the same trillion dollars to them.
So this is a show me state.
Reminds me of the line from the movie, "Show me the money."
Which one of those promises will you keep and which will you break, Governor?
Governor Bush.
Thank you for your question.
(LAUGHTER) I -- there's an old high school debating trick, which is to answer something and then attack your opponent at the end.
You asked about promises.
You were promised that Medicare would be reformed, and that Social Security would be reformed.
You were promised a middle-class tax cut in 1992.
It didn't happen.
There's too much bitterness in Washington.
There's too much wrangling.
It's time to have a fresh start.
One of the reasons I was successful as the governor of Texas is because I didn't try to be all things to all people.
When I campaigned in a race, a lot of folks didn't think I could win including, by the way, my mother.
(LAUGHTER) I said I'd do four things; tort reform, education reform, welfare reform and juvenile justice reform.
And I won.
And I had the will of the people in my state behind me.
And then I brought folks together to get it done.
And that's what we need, I think, in this election.
To me that's what it's all about.
I'm sure your 6th grade kids are listening and saying, these guys will say anything to get elected.
But there's a record, and that's what I hope people look at.
One of my promises is going to be Social Security reform, and you bet, we need to take a trillion dollars out of that $2.4 trillion surplus.
Now remember, Social Security revenue exceeds expenses up until 2015.
People are going to get paid.
But if you're a younger worker, if you're younger, you better hope this country thinks differently, otherwise you're gonna be faced with huge payroll taxes or reduced benefits.
And you bet we're gonna take a trillion dollars of your own money and let you invest it under safe guidelines so you get a better rate of return on the money than the paltry 2% that the federal government gets for you today.
That's one of my promises.
But it's gonna require people to bring both Republicans and Democrats together to get it done.
That's what it requires.
There was a chance to get this done.
It was a bipartisan approach, but it's been rejected.
I'm going to bring them together.
Both of you -- both of you on this subject.
There are other questions that also go to this skepticism, not necessarily about you, but all people in politics.
Why is that?
Well, first of all, Jim, I would like to respond to what the governor just said.
Because the trillion dollars that has been promised to young people has also been promised to older people.
And you cannot keep both promises.
If you're in your mid-40's under the governor's plan, Social Security will be bankrupt by the time you retire, if he takes it out of the Social Security Trust Fund.
Under my plan it will be -- its solvency will be extended until you're 100.
Now that is the difference.
And the governor may not want to answer that question, he may want to call it a high school debating trick, but let me tell you this.
This election is not about debating tricks, it is about your future.
The reason Social Security -- he says it gets 2%.
You know, it's not a bank account that just pays back money that's invested.
It is also used to give your mothers and fathers the Social Security checks that they live on.
If you take a trillion dollars out of that Social Security Trust Fund, how are the checks going to be -- how are you going to keep faith with the seniors?
Now let me come directly to your question.
We have to go to the closing statements and --
Well, can I answer that?
One reason people are skeptical is because people don't answer the questions they've been asked.
The trillion dollars comes out of the surplus so that you can invest some of your own money.
There's just a difference of opinion.
I want workers to have their own assets.
It's who you trust, government or people.
All right.
Now we're going to go to closing statements.
Vice President Gore, you're first.
Thank you very much, Jim, and I'll begin by answering your questions -- your last question.
I believe that a lot of people are skeptical about people in politics today because we have seen a time of great challenge for our country.
Since the assassination of our best leaders in the '60's, since the Vietnam War, since Watergate, and because we need campaign finance reform.
I would like to tell you something about me.
I keep my word.
I have kept the faith.
I've kept the faith with my country.
I volunteered for the Army.
I served in Vietnam.
I kept the faith with my family.
Tipper and I have been married for 30 years.
We have devoted ourselves to our children and now our nearly one-and-a-half-year-old grandson.
I have kept the faith with our country.
Nine times I have raised my hand to take an oath to the Constitution, and I have never violated that oath.
I have not spent the last quarter century in pursuit of personal wealth.
I have spent the last quarter century fighting for middle-class working men and women in the United States of America.
I believe very deeply that you have to be willing to stand up and fight no matter what powerful forces might be on the other side.
If you want somebody who is willing to fight for you, I am asking for your support and your vote and, yes, your confidence and your willingness to believe that we can do the right thing in America, and be the better for it.
We've made some progress during the last eight years.
We have seen the strongest economy in the history of the United States.
Lower crime rates for eight years in a row.
Highest private home ownership ever, but I'll make you one promise here.
You ain't seen nothing yet.
And I will keep that promise.
Governor Bush, two minutes.
Well, Jim, I want to thank you and thank the folks here at Washington University and the vice president.
Appreciate the chance to have a good, honest dialogue about our differences of opinion.
I think after three debates the good people of this country understand there is a difference of opinion.
There is a difference between big federal government and somebody who is coming from outside of Washington who will trust individuals.
I've got an agenda that I want to get done for the country.
It's an agenda that says we're going to reform Medicare to make sure seniors have got prescription drugs and to give seniors different options from which they can choose.
It's an agenda that says we're listen to the young voices in Social Security and say we're going to think differently about making sure we have a system, but also fulfill the promise to the seniors in America.
A promise made will be a promise kept should I be fortunate enough to become your president.
I want to have the military keeping the peace.
I want to make sure the public school system in America keeps its promise so not one child is left behind.
After setting priorities, I want to give some of your money back.
I don't think the surplus is the government's money.
I think it's the people's money.
I don't think the surplus exists because of the ingenuity and hard work of the federal government, I think it exists because of the ingenuity and hard work of the American people.
And you ought to have some of this surplus so you can save and dream and build.
I look forward to the final weeks of this campaign.
I'm asking for your vote.
For those of you for me, thanks for your help.
For those of you for my opponent, please only vote once.
(LAUGHTER) But for those who have not made up their mind, I would like to conclude by this promise.
Should I be fortunate enough to become your president, when I put my hand on the Bible, I will swear to not only uphold the laws of the land, but I will also swear to uphold the honor and the dignity of the office to which I have been elected, so help me God.
Thank you very much.
