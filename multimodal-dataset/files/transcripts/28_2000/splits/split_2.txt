We can't dictate the terms of peace, which means that you have to be steady.
You can't worry about polls or focus groups.
You've got to have a clear vision.
That's what a leader does.
A leader also understands that the United States must be strong to keep the peace.
Saddam Hussein still is a threat in the Middle East.
Our coalition against Saddam is unraveling.
Sanctions are loosened.
The man who may be developing weapons of mass destruction, we don't know because inspectors aren't in.
So to answer your question, it requires a clear vision, a willingness to stand by our friends, and the credibility for people both friend and foe to understand when America says something, we mean it.
Vice President Gore?
I see a future when the world is at peace, with the United States of America promoting the values of democracy and human rights and freedom all around the world.
Even in Iran they have had an election that began to bring about some change.
We stand for those values and we have to be willing to assert them.
Right now our military is the strongest in the entire history of the world.
I will -- I pledge to you I will do whatever is necessary to make sure that it stays that way.
Now, what can I bring to that challenge?
When I was a young man, my father was a senator opposed to the Vietnam War.
When I graduated from college, there were plenty of fancy ways to get out of going and being a part of that.
I went and I volunteered, and I went to Vietnam.
I didn't do the most or run the greatest risk by a long shot, but I learned what it was like to be an enlisted man in the United States Army.
In the Congress, in the House of Representatives, I served on the House Intelligence Committee and I worked hard to learn the subject of nuclear arms control and how we can diffuse these tensions and deal with non-proliferation and deal with the problems of terrorism and these new weapons of mass destruction.
Look, we're gonna face some serious new challenges in the next four years.
I've worked on that long and hard.
When I went to the United States Senate, I asked for an assignment to the Armed Services Committee.
And while I was there I worked on a bipartisan basis, as I did in the House, I worked with former President Reagan on the modernization of our strategic weaponry.
In the Senate I was one of only ten Democrats, along with Senator Joe Lieberman, to support Governor Bush's dad in the Persian Gulf War Resolution.
And for the last eight years I've served on the National Security Council.
Can I say just one other thing here?
No, sir.
We'll get that -- I'm gonna -- the next question is to you.
Fine, I'll wait.
It's a related -- it's a related question that is going to be asked by Kenneth Allen.
Mr. Allen?
I think he gets a -- oh, I'm sorry, you're right, go ahead.
Mr. Allen, right there.
Mr. Vice President, today our military forces are stretched thinner and doing more than they have ever done before during peacetime.
I would like to know what you are -- I think we would all like to know what you as president would do to ensure proper resourcing for the current mission and/or more selectively choosing the time and place that our forces will be used around the world.
Thank you, sir.
Just to finish briefly, I started to say that for the last eight years I've been on the National Security Council.
Last week I broke up -- I suspended campaigning for two days, or parts of two days, to go back and participate in the meetings that charted the President's summit meeting that he just returned from earlier today.
And our team of -- our country's team over there did a great job.
It's a difficult situation.
The United States has to be strong in order to make sure that we can help promote peace and security and stability.
And that means keeping our military strong.
Now, I said earlier that we are the strongest military, but we need to continue improving readiness and making sure that our military personnel are adequately paid and that the combination of their pay and their benefits and their retirement as veterans is comparable to the stiff competition that's coming in this strong economy from the private sector.
And I have supported the largest pay raise in many a year, and I support another one now.
I also support modernization of our strategic and tactical weaponry.
The governor has proposed skipping a generation of technology.
I think that would be a mistake, because I think one of the ways we've been able to be so successful in Kosovo and Bosnia and Haiti and in other places is by having the technological edge.
You know, we won that conflict in Kosovo without losing a single human life in combat, a single American life in combat.
Now, readiness.
The trends before we -- before I got my current job were on the decline, the number of divisions were reduced.
I argued that we should reverse that trend and take it back up.
And I'm happy to tell you that we have.
Now, in my budget for the next ten years I propose $100 billion for this purpose.
The governor proposes $45 billion.
I propose more than twice as much because I think it's needed.
Governor Bush, two minutes.
If this were a spending contest, I would come in second.
I readily admit I'm not going to grow the size of the federal government like he is.
Your question was deployment.
It must be in the national interests, must be in our vital interests whether we ever send troops.
The mission must be clear.
Soldiers must understand why we're going.
The force must be strong enough so that the mission can be accomplished.
And the exit strategy needs to be well-defined.
I'm concerned that we're overdeployed around the world.
See, I think the mission has somewhat become fuzzy.
Should I be fortunate enough to earn your confidence, the mission of the United States military will be to be prepared and ready to fight and win war.
And therefore prevent war from happening in the first place.
There may be some moments when we use our troops as peacekeepers, but not often.
The Vice President mentioned my view of long-term for the military.
I want to make sure the equipment for our military is the best it can possibly be, of course.
But we have an opportunity -- we have an opportunity to use our research and development capacities, the great technology of the United States, to make our military lighter, harder to find, more lethal.
We have an opportunity, really, if you think about it, if we're smart and have got a strategic vision and a leader who understands strategic planning, to make sure that we change the terms of the battlefield of the future so we can keep the peace.
This is a peaceful nation, and I intend to keep the peace.
Spending money is one thing.
But spending money without a strategic plan can oftentimes be wasted.
First thing I'm going to do is ask the Secretary of Defense to develop a plan so we are making sure we're not spending our money on political projects, but on projects to make sure our soldiers are well-paid, well-housed, and have the best equipment in the world.
Governor Bush, another kind of gun question.
It will be asked by Robert Lutz.
Mr. Lutz?
Governor Bush --
Yes, sir.
Would just like to know what is your opposition to the Brady Handgun bill?
I'm sorry, I didn't hear that.
Would like to know why you object to the Brady Handgun bill, if you do object to it.
Because in a recent TV ad it showed that the National Rifle Association says that if you are elected, that they will be working out of your office.
I don't think the National Rifle Association ran that ad.
But let me just tell you my position on guns in general, sir, if you don't mind.
Excuse me, I'm not sure he's finished with his question.
I'm sorry.
That kind of bothers me when I see an ad like that.
I want you to explain that ad to me.
Well, I don't think I ran the ad.
I think somebody who doesn't want me to be president might have run that ad.
That wasn't my ad.
I think it might have been one of my opponent's ads.
Here is what I believe, sir.
I believe law-abiding citizens ought to be allowed to protect themselves and their families.
I believe that we ought to keep guns out of the hands of people that shouldn't have them.
That's why I'm for instant background checks at gun shows, I'm for trigger locks, I think that makes sense.
Matter of fact, we distributed free trigger locks in the State of Texas so that people can get them and put them on their guns to make their guns more safe.
I think we ought to raise the age at which juveniles can have a gun.
But I also believe strongly that we need to enforce laws on the books that the best way to make sure that we keep our society safe and secure is to hold people accountable for breaking the law.
If we catch somebody illegally selling a gun, there needs to be a consequence.
If we keep somebody -- you know, illegally using a gun, there needs to be a consequence.
Enforcement of law, and the federal government can help.
There is a great program called Project Exile in Richmond, Virginia, where we focused federal taxpayers' money and federal prosecutors and went after people who were illegally using guns.
To me that's how you make society the safest it can be.
And so, yeah, sometimes I agree with some of these groups in Washington and sometimes I don't.
I'm a pretty independent thinker.
The one thing I'm for is a safe society.
And I'm for enforcing laws on the books.
And that's what is going to happen should I earn your confidence.
Vice President Gore?
Well, it was not one of my ads, either, Governor.
But I am familiar with the statement, and it was made by one of the top-ranking officials of that organization.
Let me tell you my position.
I think that some common sense gun safety measures are certainly needed with the flood of cheap handguns that have sometimes been working their way into the hands of the wrong people.
But all of my proposals are focused on that problem, gun safety.
None of my proposals would have any effect on hunters, or sportsmen, or people who use rifles.
They're aimed at the real problem.
Let's make our schools safe, let's make our neighborhoods safe.
Let's have a three-day waiting period, cooling off, so we can have a background check to make sure that criminals and people who really shouldn't have guns don't get them.
But I would like to use my remaining time on this exchange, Jim, to respond to an exchange that took place just a moment ago.
Because a couple of times the governor has said that I am for a bigger government.
Governor, I'm not.
And let me tell you what the record shows.
For the last eight years I have had the challenge of running the streamlining program called Reinventing Government.
And if there are any federal employees in this group, you know what that means.
The federal government has been reduced in size by more than 300,000 people.
And it's now the smallest number that we have had since the -- the smallest in size since John Kennedy's administration.
During the last five years, Texas's government has gone up in size.
Federal government has gone down, Texas's government has gone up.
Now, my plan for the future, I see a time when we have smaller, smarter government where you don't have to wait in line because you can get services online cheaper, better, faster.
We can do that.
Steve Luecker has a question, and it is for Vice President Gore.
Mr. Luecker?
There you are.
Vice President Gore.
The family farms are disappearing and having a hard time even in the current positive economic environment.
What steps would you or your administration take on agricultural policy developments to protect the family farms for this multi-functional service they perform?
We've got a bumper crop this year.
But that's the good news.
You know what the bad news is that follows on that.
The prices are low.
In the last several years, the so-called Freedom To Farm Law has, in my view, been mostly a failure.
I want to change many of its provisions.
Now, many here who are not involved in farming don't -- won't follow this, so just forgive me.
Because the 2% of the country that is involved in farming is important because the rest of us wouldn't eat except for them.
And you guys have been having a hard time, and I want to fight for you.
I want to change those provisions.
I want to restore a meaningful safety net.
And I think that you pointed the way in your comments, because when you say there are multiple things accomplished by farmers, you're specifically including conservation and protection of the environment.
And yes, farmers are the first environmentalists.
And when they decide not to plow a field that is vulnerable to soil erosion, that may cost them a little money, but it helps the environment.
I think that we ought to have an expanded conservation reserve program.
And I think that the environmental benefits that come from sound management of the land ought to represent a new way for farmers to get some income that will enable them -- enable you to make sensible choices in crop rotation, and when you leave the land fallow and the rest.
Now, I'll go beyond that and say I think we need much more focus on rural economic development programs.
I see a time when the Internet-based activities are more available in the rural areas and where the extra source of income that farm families used to have from shoe factories is replaced by an extra source of income from working in the information economy.
So we need to do a lot of things, but we ought to start with a better safety net.
Governor Bush, two minutes.
I would like our farmers feeding the world.
We're the best producers in the world, and I want -- I want the farmers feeding the world.
We need to open up markets.
Exports are down, and every time an export number goes down, it hurts the farmer.
I want the next president to have fast track negotiating authority to open up markets around the world.
Weâ€™re the best and the most efficient farmers.
I don't want to use food as a diplomatic weapon from this point forward.
We shouldn't be using food.
It hurts the farmers.
It's not the right thing to do.
I'm for value-added processing.
We need more work on value-added processing.
You take the raw product you produce, I presume you're a farmer, off your farm, and you convert it.
Value-added processing is important.
I'm for research and development.
Spending research and development money so that we can use our technological base to figure out new uses for farm products.
I'm for getting rid of the death tax, completely getting rid of the death tax.
One reason family farmers are forced to sell early is because of the death tax.
This is a bad tax.
The President shouldn't have vetoed that bill.
It's a tax that taxes people twice.
It penalizes the family farmer.
So should I be fortunate enough to earn your vote, I also understand -- I want to open up markets, but I also understand that farming is a part of our national security.
I'm from a big farm state.
We're the second biggest state -- farming state in the country.
And I hear from my farmers and friends all the time.
The Vice President is right, by the way.
Every day is earth day if you own the land.
I like the policies that will encourage farmers to put -- set aside land as well for conservation purposes.
Thank you.
A quick thing on the inheritance tax.
There is a difference between the two of you on this.
Vice President Gore?
Yeah.
I'm for a massive reform of the estate tax or the death tax.
And under the plan that I've proposed, 80% of all family farms will be completely exempt from the estate tax.
And the vast majority of all family businesses would be completely exempt, and all of the others would have sharply reduced.
So 80% -- now the problem with completely eliminating it goes back to the wealthiest 1%.
The amount of money that has to be raised in taxes for middle-class families to make up for completely eliminating that on the very wealthiest, the billionaires, that would be an extra heavy burden on middle-class families.
And so let's do it for most all, but not completely eliminate it for the very top.
What's the case for doing that, Governor?
Eliminating the death tax.
Completely.
For everybody.
Because people shouldn't be taxed twice on their assets.
It's either unfair for some or unfair for all.
Again, this is just a difference of opinion.
If you're from Washington, you want to pick and choose winners.
I don't think that's the role of the president.
I think if you're going to have tax relief, everybody benefits.
Secondly, I think your plan -- a lot of fine print in your plan, Mr. Vice President, with all due respect.
It is -- I'm not so sure 80% of the people get the death tax.
I know this, 100% will get it if I'm the president.
I just don't think it's fair to tax people's assets twice regardless of your status.
It's a fairness issue.
It's an issue of principle, not politics.
New issue.
New issue.
And the question will be asked by Joyce Cleamer of Governor Bush.
Joyce Cleamer?
There you are.
Hi, Joyce.
Hi, Governor.
I'm very concerned about the morality of our country now.
TV, movies, the music that our children are, you know, barraged with every day.
And I want to know if there's anything that can be worked out with the -- Hollywood, or whoever, to help get rid of some of this bad language and whatever, you know.
It's just bringing the country down.
And our children are very important to us and we're concerned about their education at school.
We should be concerned about their education at home, also.
Thank you.
Appreciate that question.
Laura and I are proud parents of teenage girls, twin daughters, and I know what you're saying.
Government ought to stand on the side of parents.
Parents are teaching their children right from wrong, and the message oftentimes gets undermined by the popular culture.
You bet there's things that government can do.
We can work with the entertainment industry to provide family hour.
We can have filters on Internets where public money is spent.
There ought to be filters in public libraries and filters in public schools so if kids get on the Internet, there is not going to be pornography or violence coming in.
I think we ought to have character education in our schools.
I know that
