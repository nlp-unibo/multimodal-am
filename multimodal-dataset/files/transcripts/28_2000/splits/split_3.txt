doesn't directly talk about Hollywood, but it does reinforce the values you're teaching.
Greatly expand character education funding so that public schools will teach children values, values which have stood the test of time.
There's afterschool money available.
I think that afterschool money ought to be available for faith-based programs and charitable programs that exist because somebody has heard the call to love a neighbor like you would like to be loved yourself.
That will help reinforce the values that parents teach at home as well.
Ours is a great land, and one of the reasons why is because we're free.
And so I don't support censorship.
But I do believe that we ought to talk plainly to the Hollywood moguls and people who produce this stuff and explain the consequences.
I think we need to have rating systems that are clear.
I happen to like the idea of having technology for the TV, easy for parents to use so you can tune out these programs you don't want in your house.
I'll remind mothers and dads the best weapon is the off/on button, and paying attention to your children, and eating dinner with them and being -- I'm sorry.
I was on my peroration.
My turn.
Vice President Gore.
I care a lot about this.
It's not just movies; television, video games, music, the Internet.
Parents now feel like you have to compete with the mass culture in order to raise your kids with the values that you want them to have.
Tipper and I have four children.
And God bless them, every one of them decided on their own to come here this evening.
I don't want to embarrass our oldest daughter.
She and her husband made us grandparents almost a year-and-a-half ago, and yet if she'll forgive me, when she was little, she brought a record home that had some awful lyrics in it and Tipper hit the ceiling.
And that launched a campaign to try to get the record companies to put ratings that -- warning labels for parents.
And I'm so proud of what she accomplished in getting them on there.
I've been involved myself in negotiating and helping to move along the negotiations with the Internet service providers to get a parents' protection page every time 95% of the pages come up.
And a feature that allows parents to automatically check with one click what sites your kids have visited lately.
You know, some parents are worried about those filters, that you will have to ask your kids how to put them on there.
But if you can check up on them, that's real power.
And recently the Federal Trade Commission pointed out that some of these entertainment companies have warned parents that the material is inappropriate for children, and then they've turned around behind the backs of the parents and advertised that same adult material directly to children.
That is an outrage.
Joe Lieberman and I gave them six months to clean up their act.
And if they don't do it, we're gonna ask for tougher authority in the hands of the FTC on the false and deceptive advertising.
I'll tell you this, I want to do something about this.
Respect the First Amendment, but I will do something to help you raise your kids without that garbage.
All right.
Vice President Gore, the next question is for you, and it will be asked by Steven Koosmann.
Mr. Koosmann, where are you, sir?
You're right behind me as well.
There we go.
Right next to the last.
It seems that when we hear about issues of this campaign, it's usually Medicare, Social Security or prescription drugs.
As a college professor, I hear a lot of apathy amongst young people who feel that there are no issues directed to them.
And they don't plan to vote.
How do you address that?
We've got to change it.
I spend a good deal of time talking to young people, and in my standard speech out there on the stump I usually end my speech by saying, I want to ask you for something and I want to direct it especially to the young people in the audience.
And I want to tell you what I tell them.
Sometimes people who are very idealistic and have great dreams, as young people do, are apt to stay at arm's length from the political process because they think their good hearts might be brittle, and if they invest their hopes and allow themselves to believe, then they're gonna be let down and disappointed.
But thank goodness we've always had enough people who have been willing in every generation to push past the fear of a broken heart and become deeply involved in forming a more perfect union.
We're America, and we believe in our future and we know we have the ability to shape our future.
Now, we've got to address one of the biggest threats to our democracy.
And that is the current campaign financing system.
And I know they say it doesn't rank anywhere on the polls.
I don't believe that's a fair measure.
I'm telling you, I will make it the -- I will make the McCain-Feingold Campaign Finance Reform bill the very first measure that I send to the Congress as president.
Governor Bush opposes it.
I wish that he would consider changing his mind on that.
Because I think that the special interests have too much power, and we need to give our democracy back to the American people.
Let me tell you why.
Those issues you mentioned, Social Security, prescription drugs, the big drug companies are against the prescription drug proposal that I've made.
The HMOs are against the patient's rights bill, the Dingle-Norwood bill that I support, and that Gov.
Bush does not support.
The big oil companies are against the measures to get more energy independence and renewable fuel.
They ought to have their voices heard, but they shouldn't have a big megaphone that drowns out the American people.
We need campaign finance reform and we need to shoot straight with young and old alike and tell them what the real choices are.
And we can renew and rekindle the American spirit and make our future what our founders dreamed it could be.
We can.
Governor Bush, two minutes.
Tell you what I hear.
A lot of people are sick and tired of the bitterness in Washington, D.C. and therefore they don't want any part of politics.
They look at Washington and see people pointing fingers and casting blame and saying one thing and doing another.
There's a lot of young folks saying, you know, why do I want to be involved with this mess?
And what I think needs to happen in order to encourage the young to become involved is to shoot straight, is to set aside the partisan differences, and set an agenda that will make sense.
Medicare, I know you talked about it, but Medicare is relevant for all of us, young and old alike.
We better get it right now.
Tax reform is relevant for old and young alike.
I don't think it's the issues that turn kids off.
I think it's the tone.
I think it's the attitude.
I think it's a cynicism in Washington and it doesn't have to be that way.
Before I decided to run, I had to resolve two issues in my mind.
One, could our family endure all this business.
And I came to the conclusion that our love was strong enough to be able to do it.
The other was could an administration change the tone in Washington, D.C. And I believe the answer is yes, otherwise I wouldn't be asking for your vote.
That's what happened in Texas.
We worked together.
There is a man here in this audience named Hugo Berlanga.
He is the chairman of the health committee.
He came here for a reason, to tout our record on health in Texas.
He's a Democrat.
I didn't care whether he was a Republican or Democrat.
What I cared about is could we work together.
That's what Washington, D.C. needs.
And finally, sir, to answer your question, you need somebody in office who will tell the truth.
That's the best way to get people back in the system.
Governor Bush, Norma Curby has the next question.
And it's for you.
Norma Curby, where are you?
Hi, Norma.
Hi.
How will your administration address diversity, inclusiveness, and what role will affirmative action play in your overall plan?
I've had a record of bringing people from all walks of life into my administration, and my administration is better off for it in Texas.
I'm going to find people that want to serve their country.
But I want a diverse administration, I think it's important.
I've worked hard in the State of Texas to make sure our institutions reflect the state with good, smart policy.
Policy that rejects quotas.
I don't like quotas.
Quotas tend to pit one group of people against another.
Quotas are bad for America.
It's not the way America is all about.
But policies that give people a helping hand so they can help themselves.
For example, in our State of Texas I worked with the legislature, both Republicans and Democrats, to pass a law that said if you come in the top 10% of your high school class, you're automatically admitted to one of our higher institutions of learning, college.
And as a result, our universities are now more diverse.
It was a smart thing to do.
What I called it, I labeled it affirmative access.
I think the contracting business in government can help.
Not with quotas, but help meet a goal of ownership of small businesses, for example.
The contracts need to be smaller, the agencies need to be -- need to recruit and to work hard to find people to bid on the state contracts.
I think we can do that in a way that represents what America is all about, which is equal opportunity and an opportunity for people to realize their potential.
So to answer your question, I support, I guess the way to put it, is affirmative access.
I'll have an administration that will make you proud.
Thank you.
Vice President Gore?
I believe in this goal and effort with all my heart.
I believe that our future as a nation depends upon whether or not we can break down these barriers that have been used to pit group against group, and bring our people together.
How do you do it?
Well, you establish respect for differences.
You don't ignore differences.
It's all too easy for somebody in the majority in the population to say oh, we're just all the same, without an understanding of the different life experience that you've had, that others have had.
Once you have that understanding and mutual respect, then we can transcend the differences and embrace the highest common denominator of the American spirit.
I don't know what affirmative access means.
I do know what affirmative action means.
I know the governor is against it, and I know that I'm for it.
I know what a hate crime statute pending at the national level is all about in the aftermath of James Byrd's death.
I'm for that proposed law, the governor is against it.
I know what it means to have a commitment to diversity.
I am part of an administration that has the finest record on diversity.
And incidentally, an excellent -- I mean, I think our success over the last eight years has not been in spite of diversity but because of it.
Because we're able to draw on the wisdom and experience from different parts of the society that hadn't been tapped in the same way before.
And incidentally, Mel Carnahan in Missouri had the finest record on diversity in any governor in the entire history of the State of Missouri.
And I want to honor that among his other achievements here.
Now, I just believe that what we have to do is enforce the civil rights laws.
I'm against quotas.
This is, with all due respect, Governor, that's a red herring.
Affirmative action isn't quotas.
I'm against quotas, they're illegal.
They're against the American way.
Affirmative action means that you take extra steps to acknowledge the history of discrimination and injustice and prejudice and bring all people into the American dream because it helps everybody, not just those who are directly benefitting.
Governor, what is your -- are you opposed to affirmative action?
If affirmative action means quotas, I'm against it.
If affirmative action means what I just described what I'm for, then I'm for it.
You heard what I was for.
The vice president keeps saying I'm against things.
You heard what I was for, and that's what I support.
What about -- Mr. Vice President, you heard what he said.
He said if affirmative action means quotas, he's against it.
Affirmative action doesn't mean quotas.
Are you for it without quotas?
I may not be for your version, Mr. Vice President, but I'm for what I just described to the lady.
Are you for what the Supreme Court says is a constitutional way of having affirmative action?
Let's go on to another --
I think that speaks for itself.
No, it doesn't speak for itself, Mr. Vice President, it speaks for the fact that there are certain rules in this that we all agree to, but evidently rules don't mean anything.
The question is for you, Vice President Gore, and Lisa Kee will ask it.
Lisa Kee, where are you?
There we go, sorry.
How will your tax proposals affect me as a middle-class, 34-year-old single person with no dependents?
If you make less than $60,000 a year and you decide to invest $1,000 in a savings account, you'll get a tax credit, which means in essence that the federal government will match your $1,000 with another $1,000.
If you make less than $30,000 a year and you put $500 in a savings account, the federal government will match it with $1500.
If you make more than $60,000 and up to 100 you'll still get a match, but not as generous.
You'll get an access to life-long learning and education, help with tuition if you want to get a new skill or training.
If you want to purchase health insurance, you will get help with that.
If you want to participate in some of the dynamic changes that are going on in our country, you will get specific help in doing that.
If you are part of the -- of the bottom 20% or so of wage earners, then you will get an expanded earned income tax credit.
Now, the tax relief that I propose is directed specifically at middle-income individuals and families.
And if you have a -- if you have an elderly parent or grandparent who needs long-term care, then you will get help with that.
$3,000 tax credit to help your expenses in taking care of a loved one who needs long-term care.
Governor Bush?
Let me just say the first -- this business about the entitlement he tried to describe about savings, you know, matching savings here and matching savings there, fully-funded it's gonna cost a whole lot of money, a lot more than we have.
You're going to get a tax relief in my plan.
You're not going to be targeted in or targeted out.
Everybody that pays taxes is going to get tax relief.
If you take care of an elderly in your home, you're going to get the personal exemption increased.
I think also what you need to think about is not the immediate, but what about Medicare?
You get a plan that will include prescription drugs, a plan that will give you options.
Now, I hope people understand that Medicare today is important, but it doesn't keep up with the new medicines.
If you're a Medicare person, on Medicare, you don't get the new procedures.
You're stuck in a time warp in many ways.
So it will be a modern Medicare system that trusts you to make a variety of options for you.
You're going to live in a peaceful world.
It will be a world of peace because we're going to have a clear sight of foreign policy based upon a strong military and a mission that stands by our friends.
A mission that doesn't try to be all things to all people.
A judicious use of the military which will help keep the peace.
You'll live in a world, hopefully, that is more educated so it's less likely you'll be harmed in your neighborhood.
See, an educated child is one much more likely to be hopeful and optimistic.
You'll be in a world in which fits into my philosophy.
The harder you work, the more you can keep.
It's the American way.
Government shouldn't be a heavy hand.
It's what the federal government does to you.
It should be a helping hand, and tax relief and the proposals I just described should be a good helping hand.
Governor, next question is for you, and Leo Anderson will ask it.
Mr. Anderson.
You want a mike?
In one of the last debates held, the subject of capital punishment came up, and in your response to the question, you seemed overly joyed and as a matter of fact proud that Texas led the nation in the execution of prisoners.
Sir, did I misread your response and are you really, really proud of the fact that Texas is number one in executions?
No, I'm not proud of that.
The death penalty is a very serious business, Leo.
It's an issue that good people obviously disagree on.
I take my job seriously.
And if you think I was proud of it, I think you misread me, I do.
I was sworn to uphold the laws of my state.
During the course of the campaign in 1994 I was asked do you support the death penalty.
I said I did if administered fairly and justly.
Because I believe it saves lives, Leo, I do.
If it's administered swiftly, justly and fairly, it saves lives.
One of the things that happens when you're a governor, at least oftentimes you have to make tough decisions.
You can't let public persuasion sway you, because the job is to enforce the law.
And that's what I did, sir.
There have been some tough cases come across my desk.
Some of the hardest moments since I've been the governor of the State of Texas is to deal with those cases.
But my job is to ask two questions, sir.
Is the person guilty of the crime?
And did the person have full access to the courts of law?
And I can tell you looking at you right now, in all cases those answers were affirmative.
I'm not proud of any record.
I'm proud of the fact that violent crime is down in the State of Texas.
I'm proud of the fact that we hold people accountable.
But I'm not proud of any record, sir, I'm not.
Vice President Gore?
I support the death penalty.
I think that it has to be administered not only fairly with attention to
