get in a program that has already brought the rate of spending of government down from 17 percent to 6.1 percent, a program of returning authority and autonomy to the local and State governments that has been unjustly seized by the Federal Government.
And you might find those words in a Democratic platform of some years ago -- I know, because I was a Democrat at that time.
And I left the party eventually, because I could no longer follow the turn in the Democratic leadership that took us down an entirely different path, a path of centralizing authority in the Federal Government, lacking trust in the American people.
I promised, when we took office, that we would reduce inflation.
We have, to one-third of what it was.
I promised that we would reduce taxes.
We did, 25 percent across the board.
That barely held even with -- if it did that much -- with the gigantic tax increase imposed in 1977.
But at least it took that burden away from them.
I said that we would create jobs for our people, and we did -- 6 million in the last 20 or 21 months.
I said that we would become respected in the world once again and that we would refurbish our national defense to the place that we could deal on the world scene and then seek disarmament, reduction of arms, and, hopefully, an elimination of nuclear weapons.
We have done that.
All of the things that I said we would do, from inflation being down, interest rates being down, unemployment falling, all of those things we have done.
And I think this is something the American people see.
I think they also know that we had a commission that came in a year ago with a recommendation on education -- on excellence in education.
And today, without the Federal Government being involved other than passing on to them, the school districts, the words from that commission, we find 35 States with task forces now dealing with their educational problems.
We find that schools are extending the curriculum to now have forced teaching of mathematics and science and so forth.
All of these things have brought an improvement in the college entrance exams for the first time in some 20 years.
So, I think that many Democrats are seeing the same thing this Democrat saw: The leadership isn't taking us where we want to go.
Mr. President, much of what you said affects the quality of life of many Americans -- their income, the way they live, and so forth -- but there's an aspect to quality of life that lies beyond the private sector which has to do with our neighborhoods, our cities, our streets, our parks, our environment.
In those areas, I have difficulty seeing what your program is and what you feel the Federal responsibility is in these areas of the quality of life in the public sector that affects everybody, and even enormous wealth by one individual can't create the kind of environment that he might like.
There are tasks that government legitimately should enforce and tasks that government performs well, and you've named some of them.
Crime has come down the last 2 years, for the first time in many, many decades that it has come down -- or since we've kept records -- 2 consecutive years, and last year it came down the biggest drop in crime that we've had.
I think that we've had something to do with that, just as we have with the drug problem nationwide.
The environment?
Yes, I feel as strongly as anyone about the preservation of the environment.
When we took office, we found that the national parks were so dirty and contained so many hazards, lack of safety features, that we stopped buying additional park land until we had rectified this with what was to be a 5-year program -- but it's just about finished already -- a billion dollars.
And now we're going back to budgeting for additional lands for our parks.
We have added millions of acres to the wilderness lands, to the game refuges.
I think that we're out in front of most -- and I see that the red light is blinking, so I can't continue.
But I've got more.
Well, you'll have a chance when your rebuttal time comes up, perhaps, Mr. President.
Mr. Mondale, now it's your turn for rebuttal.
The President says that when the Democratic Party made its turn, he left it.
The year that he decided we had lost our way was the year that John F. Kennedy was running against Richard Nixon.
I was chairman of "Minnesotans for Kennedy;'' President Reagan was chairman of a thing called "Democrats for Nixon.''
Now, maybe we made a wrong turn with Kennedy, but I'll be proud of supporting him all of my life.
And I'm very happy that John Kennedy was elected, because John Kennedy looked at the future with courage, saw what needed to be done, and understood his own government.
The President just said that his government is shrinking.
It's not.
It's now the largest peacetime government ever in terms of the take from the total economy.
And instead of retreating -- instead of being strong where we should be strong, he wants to make it strong and intervene in the most private and personal questions in American life.
That's where government should not be.
Mr. President?
Before I campaigned as a Democrat for a Republican candidate for President, I had already voted for Dwight Eisenhower to be President of the United States.
And so, my change had come earlier than that.
I hadn't gotten around to reregistering as yet.
I found that was rather difficult to do.
But I finally did it.
There are some other things that have been said here -- back, and you said that I might be able to dredge them up.
Mr. Mondale referred to the farmers' worst year.
The farmers are not the victims of anything this administration has done.
The farmers were the victims of the double-digit inflation and the 21\1/2\-percent interest rates of the Carter-Mondale administration and the grain embargo, which destroyed our reliability nationwide as a supplier.
All of these things are presently being rectified, and I think that we are going to salvage the farmers.
As a matter of fact, there has been less than one-quarter of 1 percent of foreclosures of the 270,000 loans from government that the farmers have.
Thank you, Mr. President.
We'll now turn to Diane Sawyer for her round of questions.
Diane?
Abortion
I'd like to turn to an area that I think few people enjoy discussing, but that we probably should tonight because the positions of the two candidates are so clearly different and lead to very different policy consequences -- and that is abortion and right to life.
I'm exploring for your personal views of abortion and specifically how you would want them applied as public policy.
First, Mr. President.
Do you consider abortion murder or a sin?
And second, how hard would you work -- what kind of priority would you give in your second term legislation to make abortion illegal?
And specifically, would you make certain, as your party platform urges, that Federal justices that you appoint be prolife?
I have believed that in the appointment of judges that all that was specified in the party platform was that they respect the sanctity of human life.
Now, that I would want to see in any judge and with regard to any issue having to do with human life.
But with regard to abortion, and I have a feeling that this is -- there's been some reference without naming it here in the remarks of Mr. Mondale tied to injecting religion into government.
With me, abortion is not a problem of religion, it's a problem of the Constitution.
I believe that until and unless someone can establish that the unborn child is not a living human being, then that child is already protected by the Constitution, which guarantees life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness to all of us.
And I think that this is what we should concentrate on, is trying -- I know there were weeks and weeks of testimony before a Senate committee, there were medical authorities, there were religious -- there were clerics there -- everyone talking about this matter of prolife.
And at the end of all of that, not one shred of evidence was introduced that the unborn child was not alive.
We have seen premature births that are now grown-up, happy people going around.
Also, there is a strange dichotomy in this whole position about our courts ruling that abortion is not the taking of a human life.
In California, sometime ago, a man beat a woman so savagely that her unborn child was born dead with a fractured skull, and the California State Legislature unanimously passed a law that was signed by the then-Democratic Governor -- signed a law that said that any man who so abuses a pregnant woman that he causes the death of her unborn child shall be charged with murder.
Now, isn't it strange that that same woman could have taken the life of her unborn child, and it was abortion and not murder, but if somebody else does it, that's murder?
And it used the term "death of the unborn child.''
So, this has been my feeling about abortion, that we have a problem now to determine -- and all the evidence so far comes down on the side of the unborn child being a living human being.
A two-part followup.
Do I take it from what you've said about the platform, then, that you don't regard the language and don't regard in your own appointments, abortion position a test of any kind for justices -- that it should be?
And also, if abortion is made illegal, how would you want it enforced?
Who would be the policing units that would investigate?
And would you want the women who have abortions to be prosecuted?
The laws regarding that always were State laws.
It was only when the Supreme Court handed down a decision that the Federal Government intervened in what had always been a State policy.
Our laws against murder are State laws.
So, I would think that this would be the point of enforcement on this.
As I say, I feel that we have a problem here to resolve.
And no one has approached it from that matter.
It does not happen that the church that I belong to had that as part of its dogma.
I know that some churches do.
Now, it is a sin if you're taking a human life.
At the same time, in our Judeo-Christian tradition, we recognize the right of taking a human life in self-defense.
And therefore, I've always believed that a mother, if medically it is determined that her life is at risk if she goes through with the pregnancy, she has a right then to take the life of even her own unborn child in defense of her own.
Mr. Mondale, to turn to you, do you consider abortion a murder or a sin?
And bridging from what President Reagan said, he has written that if society doesn't know whether life does -- human life, in fact, does begin at conception, as long as there is a doubt, that the unborn child should at least be given the benefit of the doubt and that there should be protection for that unborn child.
This is one of the most emotional and difficult issues that could possibly be debated.
I think your questions, however, underscore the fact there is probably no way that government should or could answer this question in every individual case and in the private lives of the American people.
The constitutional amendment proposed by President Reagan would make it a crime for a woman to have an abortion if she had been raped or suffered from incest.
Is it really the view of the American people, however you feel on the question of abortion, that government ought to be reaching into your livingrooms and making choices like this?
I think it cannot work, won't work, and will lead to all kinds of cynical evasions of the law.
Those who can afford to have them will continue to have them.
The disadvantaged will go out in the back alley as they used to do.
I think these questions are inherently personal and moral, and every individual instance is different.
Every American should be aware of the seriousness of the step.
But there are some things that government can do and some things they cannot do.
Now, the example that the President cites has nothing to do with abortion.
Somebody went to a woman and nearly killed her.
That's always been a serious crime and always should be a serious crime.
But how does that compare with the problem of a woman who is raped?
Do we really want those decisions made by judges who've been picked because they will agree to find the person guilty?
I don't think so, and I think it's going in exactly the wrong direction.
In America, on basic moral questions we have always let the people decide in their own personal lives.
We haven't felt so insecure that we've reached for the club of state to have our point of view.
It's been a good instinct.
And we're the most religious people on Earth.
One final point: President Reagan, as Governor of California, signed a bill which is perhaps the most liberal proabortion bill of any State in the Union.
But if I can get you back for a moment on my point, which was the question of when human life begins -- a two-part followup.
First of all, at what point do you believe that human life begins in the growth of a fetus?
And second of all, you said that government shouldn't be involved in the decisions.
Yet there are those who would say that government is involved, and the consequence of the involvement was 1.5 million abortions in 1980.
And how do you feel about that?
The basic decision of the Supreme Court is that each person has to make this judgment in her own life, and that's the way it's been done.
And it's a personal and private, moral judgment.
I don't know the answer to when life begins.
And it's not that simple, either.
You've got another life involved.
And if it's rape, how do you draw moral judgments on that?
If it's incest, how do you draw moral judgments on that?
Does every woman in America have to present herself before some judge picked by Jerry Falwell to clear her personal judgment?
It won't work.
[Applause]
I'm sorry to do this, but I really must talk to the audience.
You're all invited guests.
I know I'm wasting time in talking to you, but it really is very unfair of you to applaud -- sometimes louder, less loud -- and I ask you, as people who were invited here, and polite people, to refrain.
We have our time now for rebuttal.
Mr. President.
Yes.
Well, with regard to this being a personal choice, isn't that what a murderer is insisting on, his or her right to kill someone because of whatever fault they think justifies that?
Now, I'm not capable, and I don't think you are, any of us, to make this determination that must be made with regard to human life.
I am simply saying that I believe that that's where the effort should be directed -- to make that determination.
I don't think that any of us should be called upon here to stand and make a decision as to what other things might come under the self-defense tradition.
That, too, would have to be worked out then, when you once recognize that we're talking about a life.
But in this great society of ours, wouldn't it make a lot more sense, in this gentle and kind society, if we had a program that made it possible for when incidents come along in which someone feels they must do away with that unborn child, that instead we make it available for the adoption?
There are a million and a half people out there standing in line waiting to adopt children who can't have them any other way.
Mr. Mondale.
I agree with that, and that's why I was a principal sponsor of a liberal adoption law, so that more of these children could come to term, so that the young mothers were educated, so we found an option, an alternative.
I'm all for that.
But the question is whether this other option proposed by the President should be pursued.
And I don't agree with it.
Since I've got about 20 seconds, let me just say one thing.
The question of agriculture came up a minute ago.
Net farm income is off 50 percent in the last 3 years, and every farmer knows it.
And the effect of these economic policies is like a massive grain embargo, which has caused farm exports to drop 20 percent.
It's been a big failure.
I opposed the grain embargo in my administration.
I'm opposed to these policies as well.
I'm sitting here like the great schoolteacher, letting you both get away with things -- because one did it, the other one did it.
May I ask in the future that the rebuttal stick to what the rebuttal is.
And also, foreign policy will be the next debate.
Stop dragging it in by its ear into this one.
[Laughter] Now, having admonished you, I would like to say to the panel, you are allowed one question and one followup.
Would you try, as best you could, not to ask two and three -- I know it's something we all want to do -- two and three questions as part one and two and three as part two.
Having said that, Fred, it's yours.
Federal Taxation
Thank you.
Mr. Mondale, let me ask you about middle-class Americans and the taxes they pay.
Now, I'm talking not about the rich or the poor -- I know your views on their taxes -- but about families earning 25,000 to 45,000 a year.
Do you think that those families are overtaxed or undertaxed by the Federal Government?
In my opinion, as we deal with this deficit, people from about $70,000 a year on down have to be dealt with very, very carefully, because they are the ones who didn't get any relief the first time around.
Under the 1981 tax bill, people making $200,000 a year got $60,000
