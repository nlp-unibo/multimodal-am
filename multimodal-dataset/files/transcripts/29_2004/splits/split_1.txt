I'm going to invest in homeland security and I'm going to make sure we're not cutting COPS programs in America and we're fully staffed in our firehouses and that we protect the nuclear and chemical plants.
The president also unfortunately gave in to the chemical industry, which didn't want to do some of the things necessary to strengthen our chemical plant exposure.
And there's an enormous undone job to protect the loose nuclear materials in the world that are able to get to terrorists.
That's a whole other subject, but I see we still have a little bit more time.
Let me just quickly say, at the current pace, the president will not secure the loose material in the Soviet Union -- former Soviet Union for 13 years.
I'm going to do it in four years.
And we're going to keep it out of the hands of terrorists.
Ninety-second response, Mr. President.
I don't think we want to get to how he's going to pay for all these promises.
It's like a huge tax gap.
Anyway, that's for another debate.
My administration has tripled the amount of money we're spending on homeland security to $30 billion a year.
My administration worked with the Congress to create the Department of Homeland Security so we could better coordinate our borders and ports.
We've got 1,000 extra border patrol on the southern border; want 1,000 on the northern border.
We're modernizing our borders.
We spent $3.1 billion for fire and police, $3.1 billion.
We're doing our duty to provide the funding.
But the best way to protect this homeland is to stay on the offense.
You know, we have to be right 100 percent of the time.
And the enemy only has to be right once to hurt us.
There's a lot of good people working hard.
And by the way, we've also changed the culture of the FBI to have counterterrorism as its number one priority.
We're communicating better.
We're going to reform our intelligence services to make sure that we get the best intelligence possible.
The Patriot Act is vital -- is vital that the Congress renew the Patriot Act which enables our law enforcement to disrupt terror cells.
But again, I repeat to my fellow citizens, the best way to protection is to stay on the offense.
Yes, let's do a little -- yes, 30 seconds.
The president just said the FBI had changed its culture.
We just read on the front pages of America's papers that there are over 100,000 hours of tapes, unlistened to.
On one of those tapes may be the enemy being right the next time.
And the test is not whether you're spending more money.
The test is, are you doing everything possible to make America safe?
We didn't need that tax cut.
America needed to be safe.
Of course we're doing everything we can to protect America.
I wake up every day thinking about how best to protect America.
That's my job.
I work with Director Mueller of the FBI; comes in my office when I'm in Washington every morning, talking about how to protect us.
There's a lot of really good people working hard to do so.
It's hard work.
But, again, I want to tell the American people, we're doing everything we can at home, but you better have a president who chases these terrorists down and bring them to justice before they hurt us again.
New question, Mr. President.
Two minutes.
What criteria would you use to determine when to start bringing U.S. troops home from Iraq?
Let me first tell you that the best way for Iraq to be safe and secure is for Iraqi citizens to be trained to do the job.
And that's what we're doing.
We've got 100,000 trained now, 125,000 by the end of this year, 200,000 by the end of next year.
That is the best way.
We'll never succeed in Iraq if the Iraqi citizens do not want to take matters into their own hands to protect themselves.
I believe they want to.
Prime Minister Allawi believes they want to.
And so the best indication about when we can bring our troops home -- which I really want to do, but I don't want to do so for the sake of bringing them home; I want to do so because we've achieved an objective -- is to see the Iraqis perform and to see the Iraqis step up and take responsibility.
And so, the answer to your question is: When our general is on the ground and Ambassador Negroponte tells me that Iraq is ready to defend herself from these terrorists, that elections will have been held by then, that their stability and that they're on their way to, you know, a nation that's free; that's when.
And I hope it's as soon as possible.
But I know putting artificial deadlines won't work.
My opponent at one time said, "Well, get me elected, I'll have them out of there in six months."
You can't do that and expect to win the war on terror.
My message to our troops is, "Thank you for what you're doing.
We're standing with you strong.
We'll give you all the equipment you need.
And we'll get you home as soon as the mission's done, because this is a vital mission."
A free Iraq will be an ally in the war on terror, and that's essential.
A free Iraq will set a powerful example in the part of the world that is desperate for freedom.
A free Iraq will help secure Israel.
A free Iraq will enforce the hopes and aspirations of the reformers in places like Iran.
A free Iraq is essential for the security of this country.
Ninety seconds, Senator Kerry.
Thank you, Jim.
My message to the troops is also: Thank you for what they're doing, but it's also help is on the way.
I believe those troops deserve better than what they are getting today.
You know, it's interesting.
When I was in a rope line just the other day, coming out here from Wisconsin, a couple of young returnees were in the line, one active duty, one from the Guard.
And they both looked at me and said: We need you.
You've got to help us over there.
Now I believe there's a better way to do this.
You know, the president's father did not go into Iraq, into Baghdad, beyond Basra.
And the reason he didn't is, he said -- he wrote in his book -- because there was no viable exit strategy.
And he said our troops would be occupiers in a bitterly hostile land.
That's exactly where we find ourselves today.
There's a sense of American occupation.
The only building that was guarded when the troops when into Baghdad was the oil ministry.
We didn't guard the nuclear facilities.
We didn't guard the foreign office, where you might have found information about weapons of mass destruction.
We didn't guard the borders.
Almost every step of the way, our troops have been left on these extraordinarily difficult missions.
I know what it's like to go out on one of those missions when you don't know what's around the corner.
And I believe our troops need other allies helping.
I'm going to hold that summit.
I will bring fresh credibility, a new start, and we will get the job done right.
All right, go ahead.
Yes, sir?
I think it's worthy for a follow-up.
Sure, right.
We can do 30 seconds each here.
All right.
My opponent says help is on the way, but what kind of message does it say to our troops in harm's way, "wrong war, wrong place, wrong time"?
Not a message a commander in chief gives, or this is a "great diversion."
As well, help is on the way, but it's certainly hard to tell it when he voted against the $87-billion supplemental to provide equipment for our troops, and then said he actually did vote for it before he voted against it.
Not what a commander in chief does when you're trying to lead troops.
Senator Kerry, 30 seconds.
Well, you know, when I talked about the $87 billion, I made a mistake in how I talk about the war.
But the president made a mistake in invading Iraq.
Which is worse?
I believe that when you know something's going wrong, you make it right.
That's what I learned in Vietnam.
When I came back from that war I saw that it was wrong.
Some people don't like the fact that I stood up to say no, but I did.
And that's what I did with that vote.
And I'm going to lead those troops to victory.
All right, new question.
Two minutes, Senator Kerry.
Speaking of Vietnam, you spoke to Congress in 1971, after you came back from Vietnam, and you said, quote, "How do you ask a man to be the last man to die for a mistake?"
Are Americans now dying in Iraq for a mistake?
No, and they don't have to, providing we have the leadership that we put -- that I'm offering.
I believe that we have to win this.
The president and I have always agreed on that.
And from the beginning, I did vote to give the authority, because I thought Saddam Hussein was a threat, and I did accept that intelligence.
But I also laid out a very strict series of things we needed to do in order to proceed from a position of strength.
Then the president, in fact, promised them.
He went to Cincinnati and he gave a speech in which he said, "We will plan carefully.
We will proceed cautiously.
We will not make war inevitable.
We will go with our allies."
He didn't do any of those things.
They didn't do the planning.
They left the planning of the State Department in the State Department desks.
They avoided even the advice of their own general.
General Shinsheki, the Army chief of staff, said you're going to need several hundred thousand troops.
Instead of listening to him, they retired him.
The terrorism czar, who has worked for every president since Ronald Reagan, said, "Invading Iraq in response to 9/11 would be like Franklin Roosevelt invading Mexico in response to Pearl Harbor."
That's what we have here.
And what we need now is a president who understands how to bring these other countries together to recognize their stakes in this.
They do have stakes in it.
They've always had stakes in it.
The Arab countries have a stake in not having a civil war.
The European countries have a stake in not having total disorder on their doorstep.
But this president hasn't even held the kind of statesman-like summits that pull people together and get them to invest in those states.
In fact, he's done the opposite.
He pushed them away.
When the Secretary General Kofi Annan offered the United Nations, he said, "No, no, we'll go do this alone."
To save for Halliburton the spoils of the war, they actually issued a memorandum from the Defense Department saying, "If you weren't with us in the war, don't bother applying for any construction."
That's not a way to invite people.
Ninety seconds.
That's totally absurd.
Of course, the U.N. was invited in.
And we support the U.N. efforts there.
They pulled out after Sergio de Mello got killed.
But they're now back in helping with elections.
My opponent says we didn't have any allies in this war.
What's he say to Tony Blair?
What's he say to Alexander Kwasniewski of Poland?
You can't expect to build an alliance when you denigrate the contributions of those who are serving side by side with American troops in Iraq.
Plus, he says the cornerstone of his plan to succeed in Iraq is to call upon nations to serve.
So what's the message going to be: "Please join us in Iraq.
For a grand diversion.
Join us for a war that is the wrong war at the wrong place at the wrong time?"
I know how these people think.
I deal with them all the time.
I sit down with the world leaders frequently and talk to them on the phone frequently.
They're not going to follow somebody who says, "This is the wrong war at the wrong place at the wrong time."
They're not going to follow somebody who says this is the wrong war at the wrong place at the wrong time.
They're not going to follow somebody whose core convictions keep changing because of politics in America.
And finally, he says we ought to have a summit.
Well, there are summits being held.
Japan is going to have a summit for the donors; $14 billion pledged.
And Prime Minister Koizumi is going to call countries to account, to get them to contribute.
And there's going to be an Arab summit, of the neighborhood countries.
And Colin Powell helped set up that summit.
30 seconds, Senator.
The United Nations, Kofi Annan offered help after Baghdad fell.
And we never picked him up on that and did what was necessary to transfer authority and to transfer reconstruction.
It was always American-run.
Secondly, when we went in, there were three countries: Great Britain, Australia and the United States.
That's not a grand coalition.
We can do better.
Thirty seconds, Mr. President.
Well, actually, he forgot Poland.
And now there's 30 nations involved, standing side by side with our American troops.
And I honor their sacrifices.
And I don't appreciate it when a candidate for president denigrates the contributions of these brave soldiers.
You cannot lead the world if you do not honor the contributions of those who are with us.
He called them coerced and the bribed.
That's not how you bring people together.
Our coalition is strong.
It will remain strong, so long as I'm the president.
New question, Mr. President, two minutes.
You have said there was a, quote, "miscalculation," of what the conditions would be in post-war Iraq.
What was the miscalculation, and how did it happen?
No, what I said was that, because we achieved such a rapid victory, more of the Saddam loyalists were around.
I mean, we thought we'd whip more of them going in.
But because Tommy Franks did such a great job in planning the operations, we moved rapidly, and a lot of the Baathists and Saddam loyalists laid down their arms and disappeared.
I thought they would stay and fight, but they didn't.
And now we're fighting them now.
And it's hard work.
I understand how hard it is.
I get the casualty reports every day.
I see on the TV screens how hard it is.
But it's necessary work.
And I'm optimistic.
See, I think you can be realistic and optimistic at the same time.
I'm optimistic we'll achieve -- I know we won't achieve if we send mixed signals.
I know we're not going to achieve our objective if we send mixed signals to our troops, our friends, the Iraqi citizens.
We've got a plan in place.
The plan says there will be elections in January, and there will be.
The plan says we'll train Iraqi soldiers so they can do the hard work, and we are.
And it's not only just America, but NATO is now helping, Jordan's helping train police, UAE is helping train police.
We've allocated $7 billion over the next months for reconstruction efforts.
And we're making progress there.
And our alliance is strong.
And as I just told you, there's going to be a summit of the Arab nations.
Japan will be hosting a summit.
We're making progress.
It is hard work.
It is hard work to go from a tyranny to a democracy.
It's hard work to go from a place where people get their hands cut off, or executed, to a place where people are free.
But it's necessary work.
And a free Iraq is going to make this world a more peaceful place.
Ninety seconds, Senator Kerry.
What I think troubles a lot of people in our country is that the president has just sort of described one kind of mistake.
But what he has said is that, even knowing there were no weapons of mass destruction, even knowing there was no imminent threat, even knowing there was no connection with Al Qaida, he would still have done everything the same way.
Those are his words.
Now, I would not.
So what I'm trying to do is just talk the truth to the American people and to the world.
The truth is what good policy is based on.
It's what leadership is based on.
The president says that I'm denigrating these troops.
I have nothing but respect for the British, Tony Blair, and for what they've been willing to do.
But you can't tell me that when the most troops any other country has on the ground is Great Britain, with 8,300, and below that the four others are below 4,000, and below that, there isn't anybody out of the hundreds, that we have a genuine coalition to get this job done.
You can't tell me that on the day that we went into that war and it started -- it was principally the United States, the America and Great Britain and one or two others.
That's it.
And today, we are 90 percent of the casualties and 90 percent of the costs.
And meanwhile, North Korea has got nuclear weapons.
Talk about mixed messages.
The president is the one that said, "We can't allow countries to get nuclear weapons."
They have.
I'll change that.
New question.
Senator Kerry, two minutes.
You just -- you've repeatedly accused President Bush -- not here tonight, but elsewhere before -- of not telling the truth about Iraq, essentially of lying to the American people about Iraq.
Give us some examples of what you consider to be his not telling the truth.
Well, I've never, ever used the harshest word, as you did just then.
And I try not to.
I've been -- but I'll nevertheless tell you that I think he has not been candid with the American people.
And I'll tell you exactly how.
First of all, we all know that in his state of the union message, he told Congress about nuclear materials that didn't exist.
We know that he promised America that he was going to build this coalition.
I just described the coalition.
It is not the kind of coalition we were described when we were talking about voting for this.
The president said he would exhaust the remedies of the United Nations and go through that full process.
He didn't.
He cut if off, sort of arbitrarily.
And we know that there were further diplomatic efforts under way.
They just decided the time for diplomacy is over and rushed to war without planning for what happens afterwards.
Now, he misled the American people in his speech when he said we will plan carefully.
They obviously didn't.
He misled the American people when he said we'd go to war as a last resort.
We did not go as a last resort.
And most Americans know the difference.
Now, this has cost us deeply in the world.
I believe that it is important to tell the truth to the American people.
I've worked with those leaders the president talks about, I've worked with them for 20 years, for longer than this president.
And I know what many of them say today, and I know how to bring them back to the table.
And I believe that a fresh start, new credibility, a president who can understand what we have to do to reach out to the Muslim world to make it clear that this is not, you know -- Osama bin Laden uses the invasion of Iraq in order to go out to people and say that America has declared war on Islam.
We need to be smarter about now we wage a war on terror.
We need to deny them the recruits.
We need to deny them the safe havens.
We need to rebuild our alliances.
I believe that Ronald Reagan, John Kennedy, and the others did that more effectively, and I'm going to try to follow in their footsteps.
Ninety seconds, Mr. President.
My opponent just said something amazing.
He said Osama bin Laden uses the invasion of Iraq as an excuse to spread hatred for America.
Osama bin Laden isn't going to determine how we defend ourselves.
Osama bin Laden doesn't get to decide.
The American people decide.
I decided the right action was in Iraq.
My opponent calls it a mistake.
It wasn't a mistake.
He said I misled on Iraq.
I don't think he was misleading when he called Iraq a grave threat in the fall of 2002.
I don't think he was misleading when he said that it was right to disarm Iraq in the spring of 2003.
I don't think he misled you when he said that,
