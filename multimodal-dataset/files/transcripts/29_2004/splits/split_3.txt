-- where our people could be prosecuted.
My opponent is for joining the International Criminal Court.
I just think trying to be popular, kind of, in the global sense, if it's not in our best interest makes no sense.
I'm interested in working with our nations and do a lot of it.
But I'm not going to make decisions that I think are wrong for America.
New question, Mr. President.
Do you believe that diplomacy and sanctions can resolve the nuclear problems with North Korea and Iran?
Take them in any order you would like.
North Korea, first, I do.
Let me say -- I certainly hope so.
Before I was sworn in, the policy of this government was to have bilateral negotiations with North Korea.
And we signed an agreement with North Korea that my administration found out that was not being honored by the North Koreans.
And so I decided that a better way to approach the issue was to get other nations involved, just besides us.
And in Crawford, Texas, Jiang Zemin and I agreed that the nuclear-weapons-free peninsula, Korean Peninsula, was in his interest and our interest and the world's interest.
And so we began a new dialogue with North Korea, one that included not only the United States, but now China.
And China's a got a lot of influence over North Korea, some ways more than we do.
As well, we included South Korea, Japan and Russia.
So now there are five voices speaking to Kim Jong Il, not just one.
And so if Kim Jong Il decides again to not honor an agreement, he's not only doing injustice to America, he'd be doing injustice to China, as well.
And I think this will work.
It's not going to work if we open up a dialogue with Kim Jong Il.
Thatâ€™s what he wants.
He wants to unravel the six- party talks, or the five-nation coalition that's sending him a clear message.
On Iran, I hope we can do the same thing, continue to work with the world to convince the Iranian mullahs to abandon their nuclear ambitions.
We worked very closely with the foreign ministers of France, Germany and Great Britain, who have been the folks delivering the message to the mullahs that if you expect to be part of the world of nations, get rid of your nuclear programs.
The IAEA is involved.
There's a special protocol recently been passed that allows for inspections.
I hope we can do it.
And we've got a good strategy.
Senator Kerry, 90 seconds.
With respect to Iran, the British, French, and Germans were the ones who initiated an effort without the United States, regrettably, to begin to try to move to curb the nuclear possibilities in Iran.
I believe we could have done better.
I think the United States should have offered the opportunity to provide the nuclear fuel, test them, see whether or not they were actually looking for it for peaceful purposes.
If they weren't willing to work a deal, then we could have put sanctions together.
The president did nothing.
With respect to North Korea, the real story: We had inspectors and television cameras in the nuclear reactor in North Korea.
Secretary Bill Perry negotiated that under President Clinton.
And we knew where the fuel rods were.
And we knew the limits on their nuclear power.
Colin Powell, our secretary of state, announced one day that we were going to continue the dialog of working with the North Koreans.
The president reversed it publicly while the president of South Korea was here.
And the president of South Korea went back to South Korea bewildered and embarrassed because it went against his policy.
And for two years, this administration didn't talk at all to North Korea.
While they didn't talk at all, the fuel rods came out, the inspectors were kicked out, the television cameras were kicked out.
And today, there are four to seven nuclear weapons in the hands of North Korea.
That happened on this president's watch.
Now, that, I think, is one of the most serious, sort of, reversals or mixed messages that you could possibly send.
I want to make sure -- yes, sir -- but in this one minute, I want to make sure that we understand -- the people watching understand the differences between the two of you on this.
You want to continue the multinational talks, correct?
Right.
And you're willing to do it...
Both.
I want bilateral talks which put all of the issues, from the armistice of 1952, the economic issues, the human rights issues, the artillery disposal issues, the DMZ issues and the nuclear issues on the table.
And you're opposed to that.
Right?
The minute we have bilateral talks, the six-party talks will unwind.
That's exactly what Kim Jong Il wants.
And by the way, the breach on the agreement was not through plutonium.
The breach on the agreement is highly enriched uranium.
That's what we caught him doing.
That's where he was breaking the agreement.
Secondly, he said -- my opponent said where he worked to put sanctions on Iran -- we've already sanctioned Iran.
We can't sanction them any more.
There are sanctions in place on Iran.
And finally, we were a party to the convention -- to working with Germany, France and Great Britain to send their foreign ministers into Iran.
New question, two minutes.
Senator Kerry, you mentioned Darfur, the Darfur region of Sudan.
Fifty thousand people have already died in that area.
More than a million are homeless.
And it's been labeled an act of ongoing genocide.
Yet neither one of you or anyone else connected with your campaigns or your administration that I can find has discussed the possibility of sending in troops.
Why not?
Well, I'll tell you exactly why not, but I first want to say something about those sanctions on Iran.
Only the United States put the sanctions on alone, and that's exactly what I'm talking about.
In order for the sanctions to be effective, we should have been working with the British, French and Germans and other countries.
And that's the difference between the president and me.
And there, again, he sort of slid by the question.
Now, with respect to Darfur, yes, it is a genocide.
And months ago, many of us were pressing for action.
I think the reason that we're not saying send American troops in at this point is severalfold.
Number one, we can do this through the African Union, providing we give them the logistical support.
Right now all the president is providing is humanitarian support.
We need to do more than that.
They've got to have the logistical capacity to go in and stop the killing.
And that's going to require more than is on the table today.
I also believe that it is -- one of the reasons we can't do it is we're overextended.
Ask the people in the armed forces today.
We've got Guards and Reserves who are doing double duties.
We've got a backdoor draft taking place in America today: people with stop-loss programs where they're told you can't get out of the military; nine out of our 10 active duty divisions committed to Iraq one way or the other, either going, coming or preparing.
So this is the way the president has overextended the United States.
That's why, in my plan, I add two active duty divisions to the United States Army, not for Iraq, but for our general demands across the globe.
I also intend to double the number of special forces so that we can do the job we need to do with respect fighting the terrorists around the world.
And if we do that, then we have the ability to be able to respond more rapidly.
But I'll tell you this, as president, if it took American forces to some degree to coalesce the African Union, I'd be prepared to do it because we could never allow another Rwanda.
It's a moral responsibility for us and the world.
Ninety seconds.
Back to Iran, just for a second.
It was not my administration that put the sanctions on Iran.
That happened long before I arrived in Washington, D.C.
In terms of Darfur, I agree it's genocide.
And Colin Powell so stated.
We have committed $200 million worth of aid.
We're the leading donor in the world to help the suffering people there.
We will commit more over time to help.
We were very much involved at the U.N. on the sanction policy of the Bashir government in the Sudan.
Prior to Darfur, Ambassador Jack Danforth had been negotiating a north-south agreement that we would have hoped would have brought peace to the Sudan.
I agree with my opponent that we shouldn't be committing troops.
We ought to be working with the African Union to do so -- precisely what we did in Liberia.
We helped stabilize the situation with some troops, and when the African Union came, we moved them out.
My hope is that the African Union moves rapidly to help save lives.
And fortunately the rainy season will be ending shortly, which will make it easier to get aid there and help the long-suffering people there.
New question, President Bush.
Clearly, as we have heard, major policy differences between the two of you.
Are there also underlying character issues that you believe, that you believe are serious enough to deny Senator Kerry the job as commander in chief of the United States?
That's a loaded question.
Well, first of all, I admire Senator Kerry's service to our country.
I admire the fact that he is a great dad.
I appreciate the fact that his daughters have been so kind to my daughters in what has been a pretty hard experience for, I guess, young girls, seeing their dads out there campaigning.
I admire the fact that he served for 20 years in the Senate.
Although I'm not so sure I admire the record.
I won't hold it against him that he went to Yale.
There's nothing wrong with that.
My concerns about the senator is that, in the course of this campaign, I've been listening very carefully to what he says, and he changes positions on the war in Iraq.
He changes positions on something as fundamental as what you believe in your core, in your heart of hearts, is right in Iraq.
You cannot lead if you send mixed messages.
Mixed messages send the wrong signals to our troops.
Mixed messages send the wrong signals to our allies.
Mixed messages send the wrong signals to the Iraqi citizens.
And that's my biggest concern about my opponent.
I admire his service.
But I just know how this world works, and that in the councils of government, there must be certainty from the U.S. president.
Of course, we change tactics when need to, but we never change our beliefs, the strategic beliefs that are necessary to protect this country in the world.
Ninety second response, Senator.
Well, first of all, I appreciate enormously the personal comments the president just made.
And I share them with him.
I think only if you're doing this -- and he's done it more than I have in terms of the presidency -- can you begin to get a sense of what it means to your families.
And it's tough.
And so I acknowledge that his daughters -- I've watched them.
I've chuckled a few times at some of their comments.
(LAUGHTER)  And...
I'm trying to put a leash on them.
(LAUGHTER)
Well, I know.
I've learned not to do that.
(LAUGHTER)  And I have great respect and admiration for his wife.
I think she's a terrific person...
Thank you.
... and a great first lady.
But we do have differences.
I'm not going to talk about a difference of character.
I don't think that's my job or my business.
But let me talk about something that the president just sort of finished up with.
Maybe someone would call it a character trait, maybe somebody wouldn't.
But this issue of certainty.
It's one thing to be certain, but you can be certain and be wrong.
It's another to be certain and be right, or to be certain and be moving in the right direction, or be certain about a principle and then learn new facts and take those new facts and put them to use in order to change and get your policy right.
What I worry about with the president is that he's not acknowledging what's on the ground, he's not acknowledging the realities of North Korea, he's not acknowledging the truth of the science of stem-cell research or of global warming and other issues.
And certainty sometimes can get you in trouble.
Thirty seconds.
Well, I think -- listen, I fully agree that one should shift tactics, and we will, in Iraq.
Our commanders have got all the flexibility to do what is necessary to succeed.
But what I won't do is change my core values because of politics or because of pressure.
And it is one of the things I've learned in the White House, is that there's enormous pressure on the president, and he cannot wilt under that pressure.
Otherwise, the world won't be better off.
Thirty seconds.
I have no intention of wilting.
I've never wilted in my life.
And I've never wavered in my life.
I know exactly what we need to do in Iraq, and my position has been consistent: Saddam Hussein is a threat.
He needed to be disarmed.
We needed to go to the U.N.
The president needed the authority to use force in order to be able to get him to do something, because he never did it without the threat of force.
But we didn't need to rush to war without a plan to win the peace.
New question, two minutes, Senator Kerry.
If you are elected president, what will you take to that office thinking is the single most serious threat to the national security to the United States?
Nuclear proliferation.
Nuclear proliferation.
There's some 600-plus tons of unsecured material still in the former Soviet Union and Russia.
At the rate that the president is currently securing it, it'll take 13 years to get it.
I did a lot of work on this.
I wrote a book about it several years ago -- six, seven years ago -- called "The New War," which saw the difficulties of this international criminal network.
And back then, we intercepted a suitcase in a Middle Eastern country with nuclear materials in it.
And the black market sale price was about $250 million.
Now, there are terrorists trying to get their hands on that stuff today.
And this president, I regret to say, has secured less nuclear material in the last two years since 9/11 than we did in the two years preceding 9/11.
We have to do this job.
And to do the job, you can't cut the money for it.
The president actually cut the money for it.
You have to put the money into it and the funding and the leadership.
And part of that leadership is sending the right message to places like North Korea.
Right now the president is spending hundreds of millions of dollars to research bunker-busting nuclear weapons.
The United States is pursuing a new set of nuclear weapons.
It doesn't make sense.
You talk about mixed messages.
We're telling other people, "You can't have nuclear weapons," but we're pursuing a new nuclear weapon that we might even contemplate using.
Not this president.
I'm going to shut that program down, and we're going to make it clear to the world we're serious about containing nuclear proliferation.
And we're going to get the job of containing all of that nuclear material in Russia done in four years.
And we're going to build the strongest international network to prevent nuclear proliferation.
This is the scale of what President Kennedy set out to do with the nuclear test ban treaty.
It's our generation's equivalent.
And I intend to get it done.
Ninety seconds, Mr. President.
Actually, we've increased funding for dealing with nuclear proliferation about 35 percent since I've been the president.
Secondly, we've set up what's called the -- well, first of all, I agree with my opponent that the biggest threat facing this country is weapons of mass destruction in the hands of a terrorist network.
And that's why proliferation is one of the centerpieces of a multi-prong strategy to make the country safer.
My administration started what's called the Proliferation Security Initiative.
Over 60 nations involved with disrupting the trans-shipment of information and/or weapons of mass destruction materials.
And we've been effective.
We busted the A.Q.
Khan network.
This was a proliferator out of Pakistan that was selling secrets to places like North Korea and Libya.
We convinced Libya to disarm.
It's a central part of dealing with weapons of mass destruction and proliferation.
I'll tell you another way to help protect America in the long run is to continue with missile defenses.
And we've got a robust research and development program that has been ongoing during my administration.
We'll be implementing a missile-defense system relatively quickly.
And that is another way to help deal with the threats that we face in the 21st century.
My opponent opposed the missile defenses.
Just for this one-minute discussion here, just for whatever seconds it takes: So it's correct to say, that if somebody is listening to this, that both of you agree, if you're reelected, Mr. President, and if you are elected, the single most serious threat you believe, both of you believe, is nuclear proliferation?
In the hands of a terrorist enemy.
Weapons of mass destruction, nuclear proliferation.
But again, the test or the difference between us, the president has had four years to try to do something about it, and North Korea has got more weapons; Iran is moving towards weapons.
And at his pace, it will take 13 years to secure those weapons in Russia.
I'm going to do it in four years, and I'm going to immediately set out to have bilateral talks with North Korea.
Your response to that?
Again, I can't tell you how big a mistake I think that is, to have bilateral talks with North Korea.
It's precisely what Kim Jong Il wants.
It will cause the six-party talks to evaporate.
It will mean that China no longer is involved in convincing, along with us, for Kim Jong Il to get rid of his weapons.
It's a big mistake to do that.
We must have China's leverage on Kim Jong Il, besides ourselves.
And if you enter bilateral talks, they'll be happy to walk away from the table.
I don't think that'll work.
All right.
Mr. President, this is the last question.
And two minutes.
It's a new subject -- new question, and it has to do with President Putin and Russia.
Did you misjudge him or are you -- do you feel that what he is doing in the name of antiterrorism by changing some democratic processes is OK?
No, I don't think it's OK, and said so publicly.
I think that there needs to be checks and balances in a democracy, and made that very clear that by consolidating power in the central government, he's sending a signal to the Western world and United States that perhaps he doesn't believe in checks and balances, and I told him that.
I mean, he's also a strong ally in the war on terror.
He is -- listen, they went through a horrible situation in Beslan, where these terrorists gunned down young school kids.
That's the nature of the enemy, by the way.
That's why we need to be firm and resolved in bringing them to justice.
That's precisely what Vladimir Putin understands, as well.
I've got a good relation with Vladimir.
And it's important that we do have a good relation, because that enables me to better comment to him, and to better to discuss with him, some of the decisions he makes.
I found that, in this world, that it's important to establish good personal relationships with people so that when you have disagreements, you're able to disagree in a way that is effective.
And so I've told him my opinion.
I look forward to discussing it more with him, as time goes on.
Russia is a country in transition.
Vladimir is going to have to make some hard choices.
And I think it's very important for the American president, as well as other Western leaders, to remind him of the great benefits of democracy, that democracy will best help the people realize their hopes and aspirations and dreams.
And I will continue working with him over the next four years.
Ninety seconds, Senator Kerry.
Well, let me just say quickly that I've had an extraordinary experience of watching up close and personal that transition in Russia, because I was there right after the transformation.
And I was probably one of the first senators, along with Senator Bob Smith of New Hampshire, a former senator, to go down into the KGB underneath Treblinka Square and see reams of files with names in them.
It sort of brought home the transition to democracy that Russia was trying to make.
I regret what's happened in these past months.
And I think it goes beyond just the response to terror.
Mr. Putin now controls all the television stations.
His political opposition is being put in jail.
And I think it's very important to the United States, obviously, to have a working relationship that is good.
This is a very important country to us.
We want a partnership.
But we always have to stand up for democracy.
As George Will said the other day, "Freedom on the march; not in Russia right now."
Now, I'd like to come back for a quick moment, if I can, to that issue about China and the talks.
Because that's one of the most critical issues here: North Korea.
Just because the president says it can't be done, that you'd lose China, doesn't mean it can't be done.
I mean, this is the president who said "There were weapons of mass destruction," said "Mission accomplished," said we could fight the war on the cheap -- none of which were true.
We could have bilateral talks with Kim Jong Il.
And we can get those weapons at the same time as we get China.
Because China has an interest in the outcome, too.
Thirty seconds, Mr. President.
You know my opinion on North Korea.
I can't say it any more plainly.
Well, but when he used the word "truth" again...
Pardon me?
... talking about the truth of the matter.
He used the word "truth" again.
Did that raise any hackles with you?
Oh, I'm a pretty calm guy.
I don't take it personally.
OK. All right.
You know, we looked at the same intelligence and came to the same conclusion: that Saddam Hussein was a grave threat.
And I don't hold it against him that he said grave threat.
I'm not going to go around the country saying he didn't tell the truth, when he looked at the same intelligence I did.
It was a threat.
That's not the issue.
The issue is what you do about it.
The president said he was going to build a true coalition, exhaust the remedies of the U.N. and go to war as a last resort.
Those words really have to mean something.
And, unfortunately, he didn't go to war as a last resort.
Now we have this incredible mess in Iraq -- $200 billion.
It's not what the American people thought they were getting when they voted.
All right, that brings us to closing statements.
And, again, as determined by a coin toss, Senator Kerry, you go first, and you have two minutes.
Thank you, Jim, very much.
Thank you very much to the university, again.
Thank you, Mr. President.
My fellow Americans, as I've said at the very beginning of this debate, both President Bush and I love this country very much.
There's no doubt, I think, about that.
But we have a different set of convictions about how we make our country stronger here at home and respected again in the world.
I know that for many of you sitting at home, parents of kids in Iraq, you want to know who's the person who could be a commander in chief who could get your kids home and get the job done and win the peace.
And for all the rest of the parents in America who are wondering about their kids going to the school or anywhere else in the world, what kind of world they're going to grow up in, let me look you in the eye and say to you: I defended this country as a young man in war, and I will defend it as president of the United States.
But I have a difference with this president.
I believe when we're strongest when we reach out and lead the world and build strong alliances.
I have a plan for Iraq.
I believe we can be successful.
I'm not talking about leaving.
I'm talking about winning.
And we need a fresh start, a new credibility, a president who can bring allies to our side.
I also have a plan to win the war on terror, funding homeland security, strengthening our military, cutting our finances, reaching out to the world, again building strong alliances.
I believe America's best days are ahead of us because I believe that the future belongs to freedom, not to fear.
That's the country that I'm going to fight for.
And I ask you to give me the opportunity to make you proud.
I ask you to give me the opportunity to lead this great nation, so that we can be stronger here at home, respected again in the world, and have responsible leadership that we deserve.
Thank you.
And God bless America.
Mr. President, two minutes.
Thank you very much tonight, Jim.
Senator.
If America shows uncertainty or weakness in this decade, the world will drift toward tragedy.
That's not going to happen, so long as I'm your president.
The next four years we will continue to strengthen our homeland defenses.
We will strengthen our intelligence-gathering services.
We will reform our military.
The military will be an all-volunteer army.
We will continue to stay on the offense.
We will fight the terrorists around the world so we do not have to face them here at home.
We'll continue to build our alliances.
I'll never turn over America's national security needs to leaders of other countries, as we continue to build those alliances.
And we'll continue to spread freedom.
I believe in the transformational power of liberty.
I believe that the free Iraq is in this nation's interests.
I believe a free Afghanistan is in this nation's interest.
And I believe both a free Afghanistan and a free Iraq will serve as a powerful example for millions who plead in silence for liberty in the broader Middle East.
We've done a lot of hard work together over the last three and a half years.
We've been challenged, and we've risen to those challenges.
We've climbed the mighty mountain.
I see the valley below, and it's a valley of peace.
By being steadfast and resolute and strong, by keeping our word, by supporting our troops, we can achieve the peace we all want.
I appreciate your listening tonight.
I ask for your vote.
And may God continue to bless our great land.
