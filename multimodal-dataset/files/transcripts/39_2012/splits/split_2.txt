economy, so strong that employers that are looking to find good employees and bringing them into their workforce and adapting to a flexible work schedule that gives women opportunities that they would otherwise not be able to afford.
This is what I have done.
It's what I look forward to doing and I know what it takes to make an economy work, and I know what a working economy looks like.
And an economy with 7.8 percent unemployment is not a real strong economy.
An economy that has 23 million people looking for work is not a strong economy.
An economy with 50 percent of kids graduating from college that can't finds a job, or a college level job, that's not what we have to have.
CROWLEY: Governor?
I'm going to help women in America get good work by getting a stronger economy and by supporting women in the workforce.
Mr. President why don't you get in on this quickly, please?
Katherine, I just want to point out that when Governor Romney's campaign was asked about the Lilly Ledbetter bill, whether he supported it?
He said, "I'll get back to you."
And that's not the kind of advocacy that women need in any economy.
Now, there are some other issues that have a bearing on how women succeed in the workplace.
For example, their healthcare.
You know a major difference in this campaign is that Governor Romney feels comfortable having politicians in Washington decide the health care choices that women are making.
I think that's a mistake.
In my health care bill, I said insurance companies need to provide contraceptive coverage to everybody who is insured.
Because this is not just a -- a health issue, it's an economic issue for women.
It makes a difference.
This is money out of that family's pocket.
Governor Romney not only opposed it, he suggested that in fact employers should be able to make the decision as to whether or not a woman gets contraception through her insurance coverage.
That's not the kind of advocacy that women need.
When Governor Romney says that we should eliminate funding for Planned Parenthood, there are millions of women all across the country, who rely on Planned Parenthood for, not just contraceptive care, they rely on it for mammograms, for cervical cancer screenings.
That's a pocketbook issue for women and families all across the country.
And it makes a difference in terms of how well and effectively women are able to work.
When we talk about child care, and the credits that we're providing.
That makes a difference in whether they can go out there and -- and earn a living for their family.
These are not just women's issues.
These are family issues.
These are economic issues.
And one of the things that makes us grow as an economy is when everybody participates and women are getting the same fair deal as men are.
Mr. President...
And I've got two daughters and I want to make sure that they have the same opportunities that anybody's sons have.
That's part of what I'm fighting for as president of the United States.
I want to move us along here to Susan Katz, who has a question.
And, Governor, it's for you.
Governor Romney, I am an undecided voter, because I'm disappointed with the lack of progress I've seen in the last four years.
However, I do attribute much of America's economic and international problems to the failings and missteps of the Bush administration.
Since both you and President Bush are Republicans, I fear a return to the policies of those years should you win this election.
What is the biggest difference between you and George W. Bush, and how do you differentiate yourself from George W. Bush?
Thank you.
And I appreciate that question.
I just want to make sure that, I think I was supposed to get that last answer, but I want to point out that that I don't believe...
I don't think so, Candy.
...
I don't believe...
I want to make sure our timekeepers are working here.
The time -- the time...
OK.
The timekeepers are all working.
And let me tell you that the last part, it's for the two of you to talk to one another, and it isn't quite as (inaudible) you think.
But go ahead and use this two minutes any way you'd like to, the question is on the floor.
I'd just note that I don't believe that bureaucrats in Washington should tell someone whether they can use contraceptives or not.
And I don't believe employers should tell someone whether they could have contraceptive care of not.
Every woman in America should have access to contraceptives.
And -- and the -- and the president's statement of my policy is completely and totally wrong.
Governor...
Let me come back and -- and answer your question.
President Bush and I are -- are different people and these are different times and that's why my five point plan is so different than what he would have done.
I mean for instance, we can now, by virtue of new technology actually get all the energy we need in North America without having to go to the -- the Arabs or the Venezuelans or anyone else.
That wasn't true in his time, that's why my policy starts with a very robust policy to get all that energy in North America -- become energy secure.
Number two, trade -- I'll crack down on China, President Bush didn't.
I'm also going to dramatically expand trade in Latin America.
It's been growing about 12 percent per year over a long period of time.
I want to add more free trade agreements so we'll have more trade.
Number three, I'm going to get us to a balanced budget.
President Bush didn't.
President Obama was right, he said that that was outrageous to have deficits as high as half a trillion dollars under the Bush years.
He was right, but then he put in place deficits twice that size for every one of his four years.
And his forecast for the next four years is more deficits, almost that large.
So that's the next area I'm different than President Bush.
And then let's take the last one, championing small business.
Our party has been focused too long.
I came through small business.
I understand how hard it is to start a small business.
That's why everything I'll do is designed to help small businesses grow and add jobs.
I want to keep their taxes down on small business.
I want regulators to see their job as encouraging small enterprise, not crushing it.
And the thing I find the most troubling about Obama Care, well it's a long list, but one of the things I find most troubling is that when you go out and talk to small businesses and ask them what they think about it, they tell you it keeps them from hiring more people.
My priority is jobs.
I know how to make that happen.
And President Bush has a very different path for a very different time.
My path is designed in getting small businesses to grow and hire people.
Thanks, Governor.
Mr. President?
Well, first of all, I think it's important to tell you that we did come in during some tough times.
We were losing 800,000 jobs a month when I started.
But we had been digging our way out of policies that were misplaced and focused on the top doing very well and middle class folks not doing well.
Now, we've seen 30 consecutive -- 31 consecutive months of job growth; 5.2 million new jobs created.
And the plans that I talked about will create even more.
But when Governor Romney says that he has a very different economic plan, the centerpiece of his economic plan are tax cuts.
That's what took us from surplus to deficit.
When he talks about getting tough on China, keep in mind that Governor Romney invested in companies that were pioneers of outsourcing to China, and is currently investing in countries -- in companies that are building surveillance equipment for China to spy on its own folks.
That's -- Governor, you're the last person who's going to get tough on China.
And what we've done when it comes to trade is not only sign three trade deals to open up new markets, but we've also set up a task force for trade that goes after anybody who is taking advantage of American workers or businesses and not creating a level playing field.
We've brought twice as many cases against unfair trading practices than the previous administration and we've won every single one that's been decided.
When I said that we had to make sure that China was not flooding our domestic market with cheap tires, Governor Romney said I was being protectionist; that it wouldn't be helpful to American workers.
Well, in fact we saved 1,000 jobs.
And that's the kind of tough trade actions that are required.
But the last point I want to make is this.
You know, there are some things where Governor Romney is different from George Bush.
George Bush didn't propose turning Medicare into a voucher.
George Bush embraced comprehensive immigration reform.
He didn't call for self-deportation.
George Bush never suggested that we eliminate funding for Planned Parenthood, so there are differences between Governor Romney and George Bush, but they're not on economic policy.
In some ways, he's gone to a more extreme place when it comes to social policy.
And I think that's a mistake.
That's not how we're going to move our economy forward.
I want to move you both along to the next question, because it's in the same wheelhouse, so you will be able to respond.
But the president does get this question.
I want to call on Michael Jones.
Mr. President, I voted for you in 2008.
What have you done or accomplished to earn my vote in 2012?
I'm not that optimistic as I was in 2012.
Most things I need for everyday living are very expensive.
Well, we've gone through a tough four years.
There's no doubt about it.
But four years ago, I told the American people and I told you I would cut taxes for middle class families.
And I did.
I told you I'd cut taxes for small businesses, and I have.
I said that I'd end the war in Iraq, and I did.
I said we'd refocus attention on those who actually attacked us on 9/11, and we have gone after Al Qaeda's leadership like never before and Osama bin Laden is dead.
I said that we would put in place health care reform to make sure that insurance companies can't jerk you around and if you don't have health insurance, that you'd have a chance to get affordable insurance, and I have.
I committed that I would rein in the excesses of Wall Street, and we passed the toughest Wall Street reforms since the 1930s.
We've created five million jobs, and gone from 800 jobs a month being lost, and we are making progress.
We saved an auto industry that was on the brink of collapse.
Now, does that mean you're not struggling?
Absolutely not.
A lot of us are.
And that's why the plan that I've put forward for manufacturing and education, and reducing our deficit in a sensible way, using the savings from ending wars, to rebuild America and putting people back to work.
Making sure that we are controlling our own energy, but not only the energy of today, but also the energy of the future.
All of those things will make a difference, so the point is the commitments I've made, I've kept.
And those that I haven't been able to keep, it's not for lack of trying and we're going to get it done in a second term.
But, you should pay attention to this campaign, because Governor Romney has made some commitments as well.
And I suspect he'll keep those too.
You know when members of the Republican Congress say, "We're going to sign a no tax pledge, so that we don't ask a dime for millionaires and billionaires to reduce our deficit so we can still invest in education, and helping kids go to college.
He said, "Me too."
When they said, "We're going to cut Planned Parenthood funding."
He said, "Me too."
When he said, "We're going to repeal Obamacare.
First thing I'm going to do," despite the fact that it's the same health care plan that he passed in Massachusetts and is working well.
He said, "Me too."
That is not the kind of leadership that you need, but you should expect that those are promises he's going to keep.
(CROSSTALK)
Mr. President, let me let... (CROSSTALK)
...the choice in this election is going to be whose promises are going to be more likely to help you in your life?
Make sure your kids can go to college.
Make sure that you are getting a good paying job, making sure that Medicare and Social Security... (CROSSTALK)
Mr. President.
Thank you.
(CROSSTALK)
...will be there for you.
Thank you.
Governor?
I think you know better.
I think you know that these last four years haven't been so good as the president just described and that you don't feel like your confident that the next four years are going to be much better either.
I can tell you that if you were to elect President Obama, you know what you're going to get.
You're going to get a repeat of the last four years.
We just can't afford four more years like the last four years.
He said that by now we'd have unemployment at 5.4 percent.
The difference between where it is and 5.4 percent is 9 million Americans without work.
I wasn't the one that said 5.4 percent.
This was the president's plan.
Didn't get there.
He said he would have by now put forward a plan to reform Medicare and Social Security, because he pointed out they're on the road to bankruptcy.
He would reform them.
He'd get that done.
He hasn't even made a proposal on either one.
He said in his first year he'd put out an immigration plan that would deal with our immigration challenges.
Didn't even file it.
This is a president who has not been able to do what he said he'd do.
He said that he'd cut in half the deficit.
He hasn't done that either.
In fact, he doubled it.
He said that by now middle-income families would have a reduction in their health insurance premiums by $2,500 a year.
It's gone up by $2,500 a year.
And if Obamacare is passed, or implemented -- it's already been passed -- if it's implemented fully, it'll be another $2,500 on top.
The middle class is getting crushed under the policies of a president who has not understood what it takes to get the economy working again.
He keeps saying, "Look, I've created 5 million jobs."
That's after losing 5 million jobs.
The entire record is such that the unemployment has not been reduced in this country.
The unemployment, the number of people who are still looking for work, is still 23 million Americans.
There are more people in poverty, one out of six people in poverty.
How about food stamps?
When he took office, 32 million people were on food stamps.
Today, 47 million people are on food stamps.
How about the growth of the economy?
It's growing more slowly this year than last year, and more slowly last year than the year before.
The president wants to do well.
I understand.
But the policies he's put in place from Obamacare to Dodd-Frank to his tax policies to his regulatory policies, these policies combined have not let this economy take off and grow like it could have.
You might say, "Well, you got an example of one that worked better?"
Yeah, in the Reagan recession where unemployment hit 10.8 percent, between that period -- the end of that recession and the equivalent of time to today, Ronald Reagan's recovery created twice as many jobs as this president's recovery.
Five million jobs doesn't even keep up with our population growth.
And the only reason the unemployment rate seems a little lower today is because of all the people that have dropped out of the workforce.
The president has tried, but his policies haven't worked.
He's great as a -- as a -- as a speaker and describing his plans and his vision.
That's wonderful, except we have a record to look at.
And that record shows he just hasn't been able to cut the deficit, to put in place reforms for Medicare and Social Security to preserve them, to get us the rising incomes we need.
Median income is down $4,300 a family and 23 million Americans out of work.
That's what this election is about.
It's about who can get the middle class in this country a bright and prosperous future and assure our kids the kind of hope and optimism they deserve.
Governor, I want to move you along.
Don't -- don't go away, and we'll have plenty of time to respond.
We are quite aware of the clock for both of you.
But I want to bring in a different subject here.
Mr. President, I'll be right back with you.
Lorraine Osorio has a question for you about a topic we have not...
This is for Governor Romney?
It's for Governor Romney, and we'll be right with you, Mr. President.
Thanks.
Is it Loraina?
Lorraine.
Lorraine?
Yes, Lorraine.
Lorraine.
How you doing?
Good, thanks.
Mr. Romney, what do you plan on doing with immigrants without their green cards that are currently living here as productive members of society?
Thank you.
Lorraine?
Did I get that right?
Good.
Thank you for your question.
And let me step back and tell you what I would like to do with our immigration policy broadly and include an answer to your question.
But first of all, this is a nation of immigrants.
We welcome people coming to this country as immigrants.
My dad was born in Mexico of American parents; Ann's dad was born in Wales and is a first-generation American.
We welcome legal immigrants into this country.
I want our legal system to work better.
I want it to be streamlined.
I want it to be clearer.
I don't think you have to -- shouldn't have to hire a lawyer to figure out how to get into this country legally.
I also think that we should give visas to people -- green cards, rather, to people who graduate with skills that we need.
People around the world with accredited degrees in science and math get a green card stapled to their diploma, come to the U.S. of A.
We should make sure our legal system works.
Number two, we're going to have to stop illegal immigration.
There are 4 million people who are waiting in line to get here legally.
Those who've come here illegally take their place.
So I will not grant amnesty to those who have come here illegally.
What I will do is I'll put in place an employment verification system and make sure that employers that hire people who have come here illegally are sanctioned for doing so.
I won't put in place magnets for people coming here illegally.
So for instance, I would not give driver's licenses to those that have come here illegally as the president would.
The kids of those that came here illegally, those kids, I think, should have a pathway to become a permanent resident of the United States and military service, for instance, is one way they would have that kind of pathway to become a permanent resident.
Now when the president ran for office, he said that he'd put in place, in his first year, a piece of legislation -- he'd file a bill in his first year that would reform our -- our immigration system, protect legal immigration, stop illegal immigration.
He didn't do it.
He had a Democrat House, a Democrat Senate, super majority in both Houses.
Why did he fail to even promote legislation that would have provided an answer for those that want to come legally and for those that are here illegally today?
What's a question I think the -- the president will have a chance to answer right now.
Good, I look forward to it.
Was -- Lorranna -- Lorraine -- we are a nation of immigrants.
I mean we're just a few miles away from Ellis Island.
We all understand what this country has become because talent from all around the world wants to come here.
People are willing to take risks.
People who want to build on their dreams and make sure their kids have an even bigger dreams than they have.
But we're also a nation of laws.
So what I've said is we need to fix a broken immigration system and I've done everything that I can on my own and sought cooperation from Congress to make sure that we fix the system.
The first thing we did was to streamline the legal immigration system, to reduce the backlog, make it easier, simpler and cheaper for people who
