want to do is to create an economy that is strong, and at the same time produce energy.
And with respect to this pipeline that Governor Romney keeps on talking about, we've -- we've built enough pipeline to wrap around the entire earth once.
So, I'm all for pipelines.
I'm all for oil production.
What I'm not for is us ignoring the other half of the equation.
So, for example, on wind energy, when Governor Romney says "these are imaginary jobs."
When you've got thousands of people right now in Iowa, right now in Colorado, who are working, creating wind power with good-paying manufacturing jobs, and the Republican senator in that -- in Iowa is all for it, providing tax breaks (ph) to help this work and Governor Romney says I'm opposed.
I'd get rid of it.
That's not an energy strategy for the future.
And we need to win that future.
And I intend to win it as President of the United States.
I got to -- I got to move you on --
He gets the first --
-- and the next question --
He actually got --
-- for you --
He actually got the first question.
So I get the last question -- last answer --
(Inaudible) in the follow up, it doesn't quite work like that.
But I'm going to give you a chance here.
I promise you, I'm going to.
And the next question is for you.
So if you want to, you know, continue on -- but I don't want to leave all --
Candy, Candy --
-- sitting here --
Candy, I don't have a policy of stopping wind jobs in Iowa and that -- they're not phantom jobs.
They're real jobs.
OK.
I appreciate wind jobs in Iowa and across our country.
I appreciate the jobs in coal and oil and gas.
I'm going to make sure --
OK.
-- we're taking advantage of our energy resources.
We'll bring back manufacturing to America.
We're going to get through a very aggressive energy policy, 31/2 million more jobs in this country.
It's critical to our future.
Candy, it's not going to --
We're going to move you along --
Used to being interrupted.
We're going to move you both along to taxes over here and all these folks that have been waiting.
Governor, this question is for you.
It comes from Mary Follano -- Follano, sorry.
Hi, Mary.
Governor Romney, you have stated that if you're elected president, you would plan to reduce the tax rates for all the tax brackets and that you would work with the Congress to eliminate some deductions in order to make up for the loss in revenue.
Concerning the -- these various deductions, the mortgage deductions, the charitable deductions, the child tax credit and also the -- oh, what's that other credit?
I forgot.
You're doing great.
Oh, I remember.
The education credits, which are important to me, because I have children in college.
What would be your position on those things, which are important to the middle class?
Thank you very much.
And let me tell you, you're absolutely right about part of that, which is I want to bring the rates down, I want to simplify the tax code, and I want to get middle- income taxpayers to have lower taxes.
And the reason I want middle-income taxpayers to have lower taxes is because middle-income taxpayers have been buried over the past four years.
You've seen, as middle-income people in this country, incomes go down $4,300 a family, even as gasoline prices have gone up $2,000.
Health insurance premiums, up $2,500.
Food prices up.
Utility prices up.
The middle-income families in America have been crushed over the last four years.
So I want to get some relief to middle-income families.
That's part -- that's part one.
Now, how about deductions?
'Cause I'm going to bring rates down across the board for everybody, but I'm going to limit deductions and exemptions and credits, particularly for people at the high end, because I am not going to have people at the high end pay less than they're paying now.
The top 5 percent of taxpayers will continue to pay 60 percent of the income tax the nation collects.
So that'll stay the same.
Middle-income people are going to get a tax break.
And so, in terms of bringing down deductions, one way of doing that would be say everybody gets -- I'll pick a number -- $25,000 of deductions and credits, and you can decide which ones to use.
Your home mortgage interest deduction, charity, child tax credit, and so forth, you can use those as part of filling that bucket, if you will, of deductions.
But your rate comes down and the burden also comes down on you for one more reason, and that is every middle-income taxpayer no longer will pay any tax on interest, dividends or capital gains.
No tax on your savings.
That makes life a lot easier.
If you're getting interest from a bank, if you're getting a statement from a mutual fund or any other kind of investment you have, you don't have to worry about filing taxes on that, because there'll be no taxes for anybody making $200,000.00 per year and less, on your interest, dividends and capital gains.
Why am I lowering taxes on the middle-class?
Because under the last four years, they've been buried.
And I want to help people in the middle-class.
And I will not -- I will not under any circumstances, reduce the share that's being paid by the highest income taxpayers.
And I will not, under any circumstances increase taxes on the middle-class.
The president's spending, the president's borrowing will cost this nation to have to raise taxes on the American people.
Not just at the high end.
A recent study has shown the people in the middle-class will see $4,000.00 per year in higher taxes as a result of the spending and borrowing of this administration.
I will not let that happen.
I want to get us on track to a balanced budget, and I'm going to reduce the tax burden on middle income families.
And what's that going to do?
It's going to help those families, and it's going to create incentives to start growing jobs again in this country.
Thanks, Governor.
My philosophy on taxes has been simple.
And that is, I want to give middle-class families and folks who are striving to get into the middle-class some relief.
Because they have been hit hard over the last decade.
Over the last 15, over the last 20 years.
So four years ago I stood on a stage just like this one.
Actually it was a town hall, and I said I would cut taxes for middle- class families, and that's what I've done, by $3,600.00.
I said I would cut taxes for small businesses, who are the drivers and engines of growth.
And we've cut them 18 times.
And I want to continue those tax cuts for middle-class families, and for small business.
But what I've also said is, if we're serious about reducing the deficit, if this is genuinely a moral obligation to the next generation, then in addition to some tough spending cuts, we've also got to make sure that the wealthy do a little bit more.
So what I've said is, your first $250,000.00 worth of income, no change.
And that means 98 percent of American families, 97 percent of small businesses, they will not see a tax increase.
I'm ready to sign that bill right now.
The only reason it's not happening is because Governor Romney's allies in Congress have held the 98 percent hostage because they want tax breaks for the top 2 percent.
But what I've also says is for above $250,000, we can go back to the tax rates we had when Bill Clinton was president.
We created 23 million new jobs.
That's part of what took us from deficits to surplus.
It will be good for our economy and it will be good for job creation.
Now, Governor Romney has a different philosophy.
He was on 60 Minutes just two weeks ago and he was asked: Is it fair for somebody like you, making $20 million a year, to pay a lower tax rate than a nurse or a bus driver, somebody making $50,000 year?
And he said, "Yes, I think that's fair."
Not only that, he said, "I think that's what grows the economy."
Well, I fundamentally disagree with that.
I think what grows the economy is when you get that tax credit that we put in place for your kids going to college.
I think that grows the economy.
I think what grows the economy is when we make sure small businesses are getting a tax credit for hiring veterans who fought for our country.
That grows our economy.
So we just have a different theory.
And when Governor Romney stands here, after a year of campaigning, when during a Republican primary he stood on stage and said "I'm going to give tax cuts" -- he didn't say tax rate cuts, he said "tax cuts to everybody," including the top 1 percent, you should believe him because that's been his history.
And that's exactly the kind of top-down economics that is not going to work if we want a strong middle class and an economy that's striving for everybody.
Governor Romney, I'm sure you've got a reply there.
(LAUGHTER)
You're absolutely right.
You heard what I said about my tax plan.
The top 5 percent will continue to pay 60 percent, as they do today.
I'm not looking to cut taxes for wealthy people.
I am looking to cut taxes for middle-income people.
And why do I want to bring rates down, and at the same time lower exemptions and deductions, particularly for people at the high end?
Because if you bring rates down, it makes it easier for small business to keep more of their capital and hire people.
And for me, this is about jobs.
I want to get America's economy going again.
Fifty-four percent of America's workers work in businesses that are taxed as individuals.
So when you bring those rates down, those small businesses are able to keep more money and hire more people.
For me, I look at what's happened in the last four years and say this has been a disappointment.
We can do better than this.
We don't have to settle for, how many months, 43 months with unemployment above 8 percent, 23 million Americans struggling to find a good job right now.
There are 3.5 million more women living in poverty today than when the president took office.
We don't have to live like this.
We can get this economy going again.
My five-point plan does it.
Energy independence for North America in five years.
Opening up more trade, particularly in Latin America.
Cracking down on China when they cheat.
Getting us to a balanced budget.
Fixing our training programs for our workers.
And finally, championing small business.
I want to make small businesses grow and thrive.
I know how to make that happen.
I spent my life in the private sector.
I know why jobs come and why they go.
And they're going now because of the policies of this administration.
Governor, let me ask the president something about what you just said.
The governor says that he is not going to allow the top 5 percent, believe is what he said, to have a tax cut, that it will all even out, that what he wants to do is give that tax cut to the middle class.
Settled?
No, it's not settled.
Look, the cost of lowering rates for everybody across the board, 20 percent.
Along with what he also wants to do in terms of eliminating the estate tax, along what he wants to do in terms of corporates, changes in the tax code, it costs about $5 trillion.
Governor Romney then also wants to spend $2 trillion on additional military programs even though the military's not asking for them.
That's $7 trillion.
He also wants to continue the Bush tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans.
That's another trillion dollars -- that's $8 trillion.
Now, what he says is he's going to make sure that this doesn't add to the deficit and he's going to cut middleclass taxes.
But when he's asked, how are you going to do it, which deductions, which loopholes are you going to close?
He can't tell you.
The -- the fact that he only has to pay 14 percent on his taxes when a lot of you are paying much higher.
He's already taken that off the board, capital gains are going to continue to be at a low rate so we -- we're not going to get money that way.
We haven't heard from the governor any specifics beyond Big Bird and eliminating funding for Planned Parenthood in terms of how he pays for that.
Now, Governor Romney was a very successful investor.
If somebody came to you, Governor, with a plan that said, here, I want to spend $7 or $8 trillion, and then we're going to pay for it, but we can't tell you until maybe after the election how we're going to do it, you wouldn't take such a sketchy deal and neither should you, the American people, because the math doesn't add up.
And -- and what's at stake here is one of two things, either Candy -- this blows up the deficit because keep in mind, this is just to pay for the additional spending that he's talking about, $7 trillion - $8 trillion before we even get to the deficit we already have.
Or, alternatively, it's got to be paid for, not only by closing deductions for wealthy individuals, that -- that will pay for about 4 percent reduction in tax rates.
You're going to be paying for it.
You're going to lose some deductions, and you can't buy the sales pitch.
Nobody who's looked at it that's serious, actually believes it adds up.
Mr. President, let me get -- let me get the governor in on this.
And Governor, let's -- before we get into a...
I -- I...
...vast array of who says -- what study says what, if it shouldn't add up.
If somehow when you get in there, there isn't enough tax revenue coming in.
If somehow the numbers don't add up, would you be willing to look again at a 20 percent...
Well of course they add up.
I -- I was -- I was someone who ran businesses for 25 years, and balanced the budget.
I ran the Olympics and balanced the budget.
I ran the -- the state of Massachusetts as a governor, to the extent any governor does, and balanced the budget all four years.
When we're talking about math that doesn't add up, how about $4 trillion of deficits over the last four years, $5 trillion?
That's math that doesn't add up.
We have -- we have a president talking about someone's plan in a way that's completely foreign to what my real plan is.
And then we have his own record, which is we have four consecutive years where he said when he was running for office, he would cut the deficit in half.
Instead he's doubled it.
We've gone from $10 trillion of national debt, to $16 trillion of national debt.
If the president were reelected, we'd go to almost $20 trillion of national debt.
This puts us on a road to Greece.
I know what it takes to balance budgets.
I've done it my entire life.
So for instance when he says, "Yours is a $5 trillion cut."
Well, no it's not.
Because I'm offsetting some of the reductions with holding down some of the deductions.
And...
Governor, I've gotta -- gotta -- actually, I need to have you both (inaudible).
(CROSSTALK)
I understand the stakes here.
I understand both of you.
But I -- I will get run out of town if I don't... (CROSSTALK)
And I just described -- I just described to you, Mr. President -- I just described to you precisely how I'd do it which is with a single number that people can put -- and they can put they're -- they're deductions and credits... (CROSSTALK)
Mr. President, we're keeping track, I promise you.
And Mr. President, the next question is for you, so stay standing.
Great.
Looking forward to it.
And it's Katherine Fenton, who has a question for you.
In what new ways to you intend to rectify the inequalities in the workplace, specifically regarding females making only 72 percent of what their male counterparts earn?
Well, Katherine, that's a great question.
And, you know, I was raised by a single mom who had to put herself through school while looking after two kids.
And she worked hard every day and made a lot of sacrifices to make sure we got everything we needed.
My grandmother, she started off as a secretary in a bank.
She never got a college education, even though she was smart as a whip.
And she worked her way up to become a vice president of a local bank, but she hit the glass ceiling.
She trained people who would end up becoming her bosses during the course of her career.
She didn't complain.
That's not what you did in that generation.
And this is one of the reasons why one of the first -- the first bill I signed was something called the Lily Ledbetter bill.
And it's named after this amazing woman who had been doing the same job as a man for years, found out that she was getting paid less, and the Supreme Court said that she couldn't bring suit because she should have found about it earlier, whereas she had no way of finding out about it.
So we fixed that.
And that's an example of the kind of advocacy that we need, because women are increasingly the breadwinners in the family.
This is not just a women's issue, this is a family issue, this is a middle-class issue, and that's why we've got to fight for it.
It also means that we've got to make sure that young people like yourself are able to afford a college education.
Earlier, Governor Romney talked about he wants to make Pell Grants and other education accessible for young people.
Well, the truth of the matter is, is that that's exactly what we've done.
We've expanded Pell Grants for millions of people, including millions of young women, all across the country.
We did it by taking $60 billion that was going to banks and lenders as middlemen for the student loan program, and we said, let's just cut out the middleman.
Let's give the money directly to students.
And as a consequence, we've seen millions of young people be able to afford college, and that's going to make sure that young women are going to be able to compete in that marketplace.
But we've got to enforce the laws, which is what we are doing, and we've also got to make sure that in every walk of life we do not tolerate discrimination.
That's been one of the hallmarks of my administration.
I'm going to continue to push on this issue for the next four years.
Governor Romney, pay equity for women?
Thank you.
And important topic, and one which I learned a great deal about, particularly as I was serving as governor of my state, because I had the chance to pull together a cabinet and all the applicants seemed to be men.
And I -- and I went to my staff, and I said, "How come all the people for these jobs are -- are all men."
They said, "Well, these are the people that have the qualifications."
And I said, "Well, gosh, can't we -- can't we find some -- some women that are also qualified?"
And -- and so we -- we took a concerted effort to go out and find women who had backgrounds that could be qualified to become members of our cabinet.
I went to a number of women's groups and said, "Can you help us find folks," and they brought us whole binders full of women.
I was proud of the fact that after I staffed my Cabinet and my senior staff, that the University of New York in Albany did a survey of all 50 states, and concluded that mine had more women in senior leadership positions than any other state in America.
Now one of the reasons I was able to get so many good women to be part of that team was because of our recruiting effort.
But number two, because I recognized that if you're going to have women in the workforce that sometimes you need to be more flexible.
My chief of staff, for instance, had two kids that were still in school.
She said, I can't be here until 7 or 8 o'clock at night.
I need to be able to get home at 5 o'clock so I can be there for making dinner for my kids and being with them when they get home from school.
So we said fine.
Let's have a flexible schedule so you can have hours that work for you.
We're going to have to have employers in the new economy, in the economy I'm going to bring to play, that are going to be so anxious to get good workers they're going to be anxious to hire women.
In the -- in the last women have lost 580,000 jobs.
That's the net of what's happened in the last four years.
We're still down 580,000 jobs.
I mentioned 31/2 million women, more now in poverty than four years ago.
What we can do to help young women and women of all ages is to have a strong
