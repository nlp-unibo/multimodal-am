When uh - the Nixon-Ford Administration started, this was 10 percent.
That's a 30 percent reduction in the portion that the federal government contributes to education in just eight years.
And as you know, the education cost has gone up uh - tremendously.
The last point is that the major - uh thrust has gotta be to put people back to work.
We've got an extraordinarily high unemployment rate among downtown urban ghetto areas, uh - particularly among the very poor and particularly among minority groups, sometimes 50 or 60 percent.
And the concentration of employment opportunities in those areas would help greatly not only to reestablish the tax base, but also to help reduce the extraordinary welfare cost.
One of the major responsibilities on the shoulders of uh - New York City is to - is to finance welfare.
And I favor a shifting of the welfare cost away from the local governments altogether.
And over a longer period of time, let the federal government begin to absorb part of it that's now paid by the state governments.
Those things would help a great deal with the cities, but we still have a - a very serious problem there.
President Ford.
Let me uh - speak out very strongly.
The Ford administration does have a very comprehensive program to help uh - our major metropolitan areas.
I fought for, and the Congress finally went along with a general revenue sharing program, whereby cities and uh - states, uh - the cities two-thirds and the states one-third, get over six billion dollars a year in cash through which they can uh - provide many, many services, whatever they really want.
In addition we uh - in the federal government make available to uh - cities about uh - three billion three hundred million dollars in what we call community development.
In adesh- in addition, uh - uh - as a result of my pressure an the Congress, we got a major mass transit program uh - over a four-year period, eleven billion eight-hundred million dollars.
We have a good housing program, uh - that uh - will result in cutting uh - the down payments by 50 percent and uh - having mortgage payments uh lower at the beginning of any mortgage period.
We're expanding our homestead uh - housing program.
The net result is uh - we think under Carla Hills, who's the chairman of my uh - urban development and uh - neighborhood revitalization program, we will really do a first-class job in helping uh - the communities throughout the country.
As a matter of fact, that committee under Secretary Hills released about a seventy-five-page report with specific recommendations so we can do a better job uh - the weeks ahead.
And in addition, the tax program of the Ford administration, which provides an incentive for industry to move into our major uh - metropolitan areas, into the inner cities, will bring jobs where people are, and help to revitalize those cities as they can be.
Mr. Nelson, your question next to President Ford.
Uh - Mr. President, your campaign has uh - run ads in black newspapers saying that quote, "for black Americans, President Ford is quietly getting the job done."
Yet, study after study has shown little progress in desegregation and in fact actual increases in segregated schools and housing in the Northeast.
Now, civil rights groups have complained repeatedly that there's been lack of progress and commitment to an integrated society uh - during your administration.
So how are you getting the job done for blacks and other minorities and what programs do you have in mind for the next four years.
Let me say at the outset, uh - I'm very proud of the record of this administration.
In the cabinet I have one of the outstanding, I think, administrators as the secretary of transportation, Bill Coleman.
You're familiar, I'm sure, with the recognition given in the Air Force to uh - General James, and there was just uh - approved a three-star admiral, the first in the history of the United States Navy, so uh - we are giving full recognition to individuals of quality in the Ford administration in positions of great responsibility.
In addition, uh - the Department of Justice is fully enforcing, and enforcing effectively, the Voting Rights Act, the legislation that involves jobs, housing for minorities, not only blacks but all others.
Uh - the Department of uh - uh - HUD is enforcing the new legislation that uhh - outlaws, that takes care of redlining.
Uh - what we're doing is saying that there are opportunities, business opportunities, educational opportunities, responsibilities uh - where people with talent, black or any other minority, can fully qualify.
The Office of Minority Business in the Department of Commerce has made available more money in trying to help uh - black businessmen or other minority businessmen than any other administration since the office was established.
The Office of Small Business, under Mr. Kobelinski, has a very massive program trying to help the black community.
The individual who wants to start a business or expand his business as a black businessman is able to borrow, either directly or with guaranteed loans.
I believe on the record that this administration has been more responsive and we have carried out the law to the letter, and I'm proud of the record.
Governor Carter, your response, please.
The uh - description just made of this administration's record is hard to uh - recognize.
I think it's accurate to say that Mr. Ford voted against the uh - Voting Rights Acts and the uh - Civil Rights Acts in their uh - debative stage I think once it was assured they were going to pass he finally voted for it.
This country uh - changed drastically in 1969 when the uh - terms of John Kennedy and Lyndon Johnson were over and Richard Nixon and - and Gerald Ford became the presidents.
There was a time when there was hope for those who uh - were poor and downtrodden and who were - uh elderly or who were - uh ill or who were in minority groups, but that time has been gone.
I think the greatest thing that ever happened to the South was the passage of the Civil Rights Act and the opening up of opportunities - uh to black people - the chance to vote, to hold a job, to buy a house, to go to school, and to participate in public affairs.
It not only liberated - uh black people but it also liberated the whites.
We've seen uh - in many instances in recent years a minority affairs uh - section of uh Small Loan Administration, uh - Small Business Administration lend uh - a black entrepreneur just enough money to get started, and then to go bankrupt.
The bankruptcies have gone up - uh in an extraordinary degree.
Uh - FHA, which used to be a very responsible agency, uh - that everyone looked to to help own a home, lost six million dollars last year.
There've been over thirteen hundred indictments in HUD, over eight hundred convictions relating just to home loans.
And now the federal government has become the world's greatest slum landlord.
We've got a 30 percent or 40 percent unemployment rate among minority uh - young people.
And there's been no concerted effort given to the needs of those who are both poor and black, or poor and who speak a foreign language.
And that's where there's been a great uh generation of despair, and ill health, and the lack of education, lack of purposefulness, and the lack of hope for the future.
But it doesn't take just a quiet uh - dormant uh minimum enforcement of the law.
It requires an aggressive searching out and reaching out to help people who especially need it.
And that's been lacking in the last eight years.
Mr. Kraft, to Governor Carter.
Ah - Governor Carter, ah - in the nearly two-hundred-year history of the Constitution, there've been only uh - I think it's twenty-five amendments, most of them on issues of the very broadest principle.
Uh - now we have proposed amendments in many highly specialized causes, like gun control, school busing, balanced budgets, school prayer, abortion, things like that.
Do you think it's appropriate to the dignity of the Constitution to tack on amendments in wholesale fashion?
And which of the ones that I listed - that is, uh - balanced budgets, school busing, school prayer, abortion, gun con- control - which of those would you really work hard to support if you were president?
I would not work hard to support any of those.
Uh - we've always had, I think, a lot of constitutional amendments proposed, but the passage of them has been uh - fairly slow, and uh - few and far between.
In the two-hundred-year history there's been a very uh - cautious approach to this.
We - quite often we have a transient problem.
I - I'm strongly against a- abortion.
I think abortion's wrong.
I don't think the government oughta do anything to encourage abortion.
But I don't favor a constitutional amendment on the subject.
But short of the constitutional amendment, and within the confines of the Supreme Court rulings, I'll do everything I can to minimize the need for abortions with better sex education, family planning, with better adoptive procedures.
I personally don't believe that the federal government oughta finance abortions, but I - I draw the line and don't support a constitutional amendment.
However, I honor the right of people who seek the constitutional amendments on school busing, on uh - prayer in the schools and an abortion.
But among those you named, I won't actively work for the passage of any of them.
President Ford, your response, please.
support the uh - Republican uh - platform, which calls for the constitutional amendment that would uh - outlaw abortions.
I favor the particular constitutional amendment that would turn over to the states the uh - individual right to the voters in those states uh - the chance to make a decision by public referendum.
Uh I call that the people amendment.
I think if you really believe that the people of a state ought to make a decision on a matter of this kind that uh - we ought to have a federal constitutional amendment that would permit each one of the fifty states to make the choice.
Uh - I think this is a responsible and a proper way to proceed.
Uhh - I believe also that uh - there is some merit to a - an amendment that uh - uh - Senator Everett Dirksen uh - proposed very frequently, an amendment that would uh - change the court decision as far as voluntary prayer in public schools.
Uh - it seems to me that there should have - be an opportunity, uh - as long as it's voluntary, as long as there is no uh - compulsion whatsoever, that uh - an individual ought to have that right.
So in those two cases I think uh - such uh - a constitutional amendment would be proper, and I really don't think in either case they're trivial matters.
I think they're matters of very deep conviction, as far as many, many people in this country believe.
And therefore, they shouldn't be treated lightly.
But they're matters that are ah - important.
And in those two cases, I would favor them.
Mr. Maynard to President Ford.
Mr. President, twice you have been the intended victim of would-be assassins using handguns.
Yet, you remain a steadfast opponent of substantive handgun control.
There are now some forty million handguns in this country, going up at the rate of two point five million a year.
And tragically, those handguns are frequently purchased for self-protection and wind up being used against a relative or a friend.
In light of that, why do you remain so adamant in your opposition to substantive gun control in this country?
Uh - Mr. Maynard, uh - the record of gun control, whether it's one city or another or in some states, does not show that the registration of a gun, handgun, or the registration of the gun owner, has in any way whatsoever decreased the crime rate or the use of that gun in the committing of a crime.
The record just doesn't prove that such legislation or action by a local city council is effective.
What we have to do, and this is the crux of the matter, is to make it very, very uh - difficult for a person who uses a gun in the commission of a crime to stay out of jail.
If we make the use of a gun in the commission.
of a crime a serious criminal offense, and that person is prosecuted, then, in my opinion, we are going after the person who uses the gun for the wrong reason.
I don't believe in the registration of handguns or the registration of the handgun owner.
That has not proven to be effective, and therefore, I think the better way is to go after the criminal, the individual who commits a crime in the possession of a gun and uses that gun for a part of his criminal activity.
Those are the people who ought to be in jail.
And the only way to do it is to pass strong legislation so that once apprehended, indicted, convicted, they'll be in jail and off the streets and not using guns in the commission of a crime.
But Mr. President, don't you think that the proliferation of the availability of handguns contributes to the possibility of those crimes being committed.
And, there's a second part to my follow-up, very quickly.
There are, as you know and as you've said, jurisdictions around the country with strong gun-control laws.
The police officials in those cities contend that if there were a national law, to prevent other jurisdictions from providing the weapons that then came into places like New York, that they might have a better handle on the problem.
Have you considered that in your analysis of the gu- the handgun proliferation problem?
Yes, I have.
And uh - the individuals that uh - with whom I've consulted have not uh - convinced me that uh - a national registration of handguns or handgun owners will solve the problem you're talking about.
The person who wants to use a gun for an illegal purpose can get it whether it's registered or outlawed.
They will be obtained.
And they are the people who ought to go behind bars.
You should not in the process penalize the legitimate handgun owner.
And when you go through the process of registration, you in effect, are penalizing that individual who uses his gun for a very legitimate purpose.
Governor Carter.
I - I think it's accurate to say that Mr. Ford's position on gun control has changed.
Uh - earlier, uh - Mr. Levi, his uh - attorney general, put forward a gun control proposal, which Mr. Ford later, I believe, espoused, that called for the prohibition against the uh sale aw- of the uh - so-called Saturday Night Specials.
And it would've put uh - very strict uh - uh - control over who owned a handgun.
I have been a hunter all my life and happen to own both shotguns, rifles, and a handgun.
And uh - the only purpose that I would see in registering uh - handguns and not long guns of any kind would be to prohibit the uh - ownership of those guns by those who've used them in the commission of a crime, or who uh - have been proven to be mentally incompetent to own a gun.
I believe that limited approach to the - to the question would be uh - advisable, and - and I think, adequate.
But that's as far as I would go with it.
Mr. Nelson to Governor Carter.
Uh Governor, you've said the uh - Supreme Court of today is, uh - as you put it, moving back in a proper direction uh - in rulings that have limited the rights of criminal defendants.
And you've compared the present Supreme Court under Chief Justice Burger very favorably with the more liberal court that we had under Chief Justice Warren.
So exactly what are you getting at, and can you elaborate on the kind of court you think this country should have?
And can you tell us the kind of qualifications and philosophy you would look for as president in making Supreme Court appointments?
While I was governor of Georgia, although I'm not a lawyer, we had complete reform of the Georgia court system.
We uh - streamlined the structure of the court, put in administrative officers, put a unified court system in, required that all uh - severe sentences be reviewed far uniformity.
And, in addition to that put forward a proposal that was adopted and used throughout my own term of office of selection of - for all judges and district attorneys or prosecuting attorneys, on the basis of merit.
Every time I had a vacancy on the Georgia Supreme Court - and I filled five of those vacancies out of seven total and about half the court of appeals judges, about 35 percent of the trial judges - I was given from an objective panel the five most highly qualified persons in Georgia.
And from those five, I always chose the first one or second one.
So merit selection of judges is the most important single criterion.
And I would institute the same kind of procedure as president, not only in judicial appointments, but also in diplomatic appointments.
Secondly, I think that the Burger Court has fairly well confirmed the major and - and most far-reaching and most controversial decisions of the Warren Court.
