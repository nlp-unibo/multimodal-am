Iran-contra affair, but tell me, does the Dukakis-Bentsen ticket have any realistic plan for getting the American hostages being held in the Middle East released in any due time?
Tom, that's one of the toughest problems that any chief executive will face, because you can't help but have sympathy for that family, and for those hostages in the cells.
But the one thing we ought to know by now is that you can't go out and make secret deals with the Ayatollah, you can't trade arms for hostages.
When you try to do that there is no question but what you just encourage more taking of hostages.
And that's been the result by this dumb idea that was cooked up in the White House basement.
And I want to tell you that George Bush, attending seventeen of those meetings, and having no record of what he said - if Lloyd Bentsen was in those meetings, you would certainly hear from him and no one would be asking: Where is Lloyd?
(Shouts and applause) Because I would be saying: That's a dumb idea, and now let's put an end to it.
And I would speak up on that type of thing.
So all you can do in that is to continue to push, use every bit of diplomatic pressure you can, what you can do in the way of economic pressure in addition to that.
And that's what you would strive to do to have a successful release finally of those hostages.
But not to encourage more taking of hostages.
Senator Quayle.
There's no doubt about it that arms for hostages is wrong, and it will never be repeated - we learn by our mistakes.
But there have been a number of successes in foreign policy in this administration.
But the question goes to a very difficult one: How do you do it?
No one has the answer.
If they did, we would certainly do it.
But we will keep trying, we'll keep the doors open, and hopefully some day Iran and others who control those hostages will want to return to civilized international community.
And they can do that, starting now, by releasing those hostages that are held illegally.
Brit Hume, a question for Senator Bentsen.
Senator, much of the Dukakis and Bentsen campaign of late has been devoted to the notion that Senator Quayle isn't ready for the vice presidency and perhaps the presidency, and certainly nothing that you have said here tonight suggests that you think otherwise.
I wonder if you think it's really fair for you to advance that view in light of the fact that you ran for the presidency, not the vice-presidency, in 1976 having not yet completed one full term in the Senate and having previously served three terms in the House almost a quarter of a century earlier, when in fact your time in Washington was about equal to what he has now.
Well, I think what you have to look at is the record of a man who has served his country - (Shouts, laughter) - served his country in war, headed up a squadron in combat, a man who built a business, knew what it was to meet a payroll and create jobs, and then serve in the United States Senate; and one who has been able to bring about some of the kinds of legislation that I've been able to bring about in my service there.
I must say I didn't do a very good job of running for the presidency, and I'm well aware of that.
But what we are looking at today is trying to judge once again the breadth of experience and the maturity of someone taking on this kind of a task.
That is the judgment that has to be exercised by the people of America.
It's a presidential decision that you are facing, and a very important one, because we are talking about who is going to lead this country into its future.
And you can't have a more important responsibility than that one.
Senator Quayle.
When you look at qualifications, you look at accomplishments as well as experience.
And one of the accomplishments I'm proudest of is the authorship of the Job Training Partnership Act that has trained and educated and employed over three million young people and adults that are economically disadvantaged.
And we did it in a way that we got the private sector to involve itself with the public sector on private industry councils throughout America that serve over the service delivery areas.
We have 51 percent of that private industry council that are businessmen and women; we have members of unions; we have community-based organizations; we have education leaders.
And what we have been able to do is establish a program that is working, that is putting people back to work.
That is an accomplishment, and that is an accomplishment that I will take with me into the White House.
Brit, a question for Senator Quayle.
Senator, I want to ask you a question that may be a little off the subject of politics, but which is aimed to get more at the question of what sort of person you are.
I would hope that, Senator Bentsen, if you choose to, you might choose to answer the same question in your rebuttal time.
Senator, can you identify any work of literature or art or even of film that you have seen or read or experienced in any way in the last two years that has had a particularly strong effect on you, and tell us why.
In the last six months, I think there are three very important books that I read that have had an impact.
The three books are, one, Richard Nixon's Victory in 1999, Richard Lugar's - Senator Richard Lugar's - Letters to the Next President, Bob Massey's Nicholas and Alexandra, which deals with the fall of the Russian empire and the coming of Leninism in 1917.
Those three books, which I read over the last spring vacation and early summer, had a very definite impact, because what former President Nixon and Senator Richard Lugar were talking about was a foreign policy as we move toward the 21st century.
And the historical book of the downfall of the czar and the coming of Leninism, combining those three books together, gave me a better appreciation of the challenges that we have ahead of us.
In Senator Lugar's book, he talks about the advancement of human rights around the world; he talked about his leadership effort in the Philippines and South Africa, where we now see human rights advancement on the Reagan agenda.
Former President Nixon talked about what we are going to do after detente and arms control, and how we are going to pursue new arms control with the Soviet Union; he talked a little bit about how we deal with the Soviet Union - and this is one of the differences between George Bush and Michael Dukakis, because George Bush understands that to deal with the Soviet Union and to get progress you must deal from a position of strength.
And the governor of Massachusetts doesn't understand that.
I understand it.
And a George Bush administration will pursue that policy.
Senator Bentsen.
Well, I think reading "Winds of War" and "Guns of August" back to back - I think that really shows you how we make the same mistakes too often, over and over again.
And it seems to me that the Senator from Indiana is beginning to do that one.
As I look toward our progress that's been made toward disarmament and cutting back on nuclear weapons and see what Ronald Reagan has been able to do with the INF treaty - and I think he deserves great credit with that one.
I see a situation where the Senator from Indiana has now jumped off the reservation, when we talk about building on what Ronald Reagan has done and opposes what Ronald Reagan wants to do, the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the Secretary of Defense and says let's go slow on further disarmament in trying to get the next treaty.
I think that's a mistake.
I think that you have to deal with the Russians from strength and we have to understand that you have to have a strong modernized nuclear deterrent, but I think we can make substantial progress and we ought to take advantage.
I think he's arrived at a very dangerous judgment in the question of war and peace and it concerns me very much.
Because I saw him also try to sabotage the INF treaty when it was on the Floor of the United States Senate with what he was doing there.
He's listening once again to the winds of the radical right.
Senator.
My light was still on, Judy.
John Margolis, a question for Senator Quayle.
Senator Quayle, I want to go back to the matter of qualifications, which I think for most people is more than just your -
John, we can't hear you.
Can you hear now?
I can hear you.
[Laughter.]
I want to go back to the question of qualifications, which I think for most people is more than just how long you've been in the Senate and how long you've been in public life.
There's also a question of candor and of consistency.
And several of the things you've said, both here and earlier, I think have raised some reasonable questions.
Each of them alone might seem rather trivial, but I think together they create a pattern that needs to be asked.
You've talked a few times today about the Job Training Partnership Act, which you authored.
In fact, I believe you co-authored it with another Senator, whom you almost never name.
Earlier in the campaign when you were asked why you got a very - a desk job in the National Guard after being trained as a welder, you said at the time you had a very strong background in journalism, which at that time was summer jobs at your family-owned newspaper, which you have not been very forthcoming about what they were.
As you have not been very forthcoming about your college record.
Now, I have to say - at least the males on this panel have earlier agreed that your record was probably comparable to ours, but - [Laughter.]
Nonetheless, these examples of sort of overstatement and exaggeration and not being forthcoming - this what has led a lot of people to question this part of your qualifications, not your experience, but your character.
Would you like to set some of these things straight now as to what you did in your summer jobs in college, what your grades were like and would you like to identify your co-sponsor of the Job Training Partnership Act?
All in two minutes?
Sure.
Let me start with the underlying premise, that somehow I haven't been straightforward.
And I have.
And let's go to the - right to the very first question - the Job Training Partnership Act.
I was the author of that.
The co-author in the United States Senate was Senator Kennedy.
I was the Chairman of the Employment and Productivity Subcommittee.
Chairmen of the committee write that legislation.
Chairmen of the committee write the legislation and then they go out and get co-sponsorship.
And when you are the chairman of the committee and you sit down and you write the legislation, you are the author of that.
And I'm proud to have been the author of that.
Because you know what we had, we had a CETA program that spent $50 billion from about 1973 through 1982 and when we concluded that program - when we concluded that program, unemployment was higher than when it began.
It was a program that didn't work and the Job Training Partnership Act does work.
Now, the issue of releasing all the - my grades - I am - and I stand before you tonight - as the most investigated person ever to seek public office.
(Applause)
Thousands of journalists have asked every professor I've had, all my teachers and they know - and I have never professed to be anything but an average student.
I have never said I was anything more than that, but it's not whether you're an average study, it's what are you going to do with your life.
And what have I - going to do with my life.
I have committed it to public service since I was 29 years of age - elected to the House of Representatives.
Elected to the United States Senate when I was 33.
I now have the opportunity at 41 to seek the office of the Vice Presidency.
Senator Bentsen?
I have absolutely no quarrel with Senator Quayle's military record.
But I do strongly disagree with him on some of the issues.
You make great patriotic speeches and I enjoy them, but I don't understand your vote on veterans issues.
Senator Quayle has one of the worst voting records in the United States Senate on veterans issues.
And one of them that particularly bothers me, sponsoring legislation to put a tax on combat pay and disability pay for veterans, for fighting men and women of America.
Tax on their disability pay when they're lying there in the hospital, people who have sacrificed for our country.
I think you ought to explain that to the people of America and you ought to explain it tonight.
John, a question for Senator Bentsen.
Senator, you're Chairman of the Senate Finance Committee and you're generally considered rather an orthodox conservative on fiscal matters, meaning someone who would be very concerned about the budget deficit.
With everybody in politics afraid even to mention taxes, more social security cuts or even very much restrain in defense sending, would you now list a few specific programs which would reduce or eliminate - which you would reduce or eliminate, to cut the deficit by about $50 billion, the deficit which is expected to be about $135 billion this Fiscal Year.
One of them that I'd work on - and I do this as a farmer - I try to turn the situation around where we have seen the subsidy payments go from two and a half billion to ten times that under this administration.
And the way I would accomplish that--was with a tough trade policy, opening up those markets, getting those prices back up to market prices.
We can do that if we have an aggressive trade policy for our country, if we make trade a number one priority and not trade it off for some foreign policy objective at the moment.
That means we have to stand up for the American farmers and that cuts back on the regulation on American farmers.
That's a positive way to accomplish that.
In addition to that, we do some of the things that I think have to be done insofar as doing a better job of procurement, particularly when we're talking about some of our military things that we should buy.
I know that I fought very hard to put in an independent inspector general for the Defense Department, that the Senator from Indiana opposed me on that.
But we were finally able to put that into effect and we saved over a quarter of a billion dollars this year, almost enough to buy a squadron of 716s.
Those are the kids of things that I'd work on.
One of the things I learned in business is that you can expect what you inspect.
So, we'd be a - doing a much tougher job of auditing, to try to get rid of some of these kickbacks to consultants on military contracts, to be much more aggressive on that.
In addition, those types of things would bring the interest rate down.
I'd try to turn this trade deficit around and that too would help us and help us very substantially.
And I'd get rid of some things like these planes that - are going to have - that the administration wants that'll fly from New York to Tokyo and take those investment bankers over there in four hours.
I don't think we can afford a piece of technological elegance like that.
I'd strike that sort of thing from the ticket.
I don't know how many people have ridden the Concorde, not many, but I voted against it, said it would be a financial disaster and it's been just that.
Senator.
So, those are the types of things that I would work on.
Senator Quayle?
The way we're going to reduce this budget deficit, and it is a challenge to make sure that it is reduce, is first to stick to the Gramm-Rudman targets.
The Gramm-Rudman targets have worked.
We've reduced the Federal budget deficit $70 billion.
Senator Bentsen voted against Gramm-Rudman, the very tool that has been used to bring the Federal budget deficit down.
We're going to need all the tools possible to bring this Federal budget deficit down.
We need the tools of a line item veto.
A line item veto that 43 governors in this country have, but not the President of the United States.
The President of the United States needs to have a line item veto.
When Congress goes ahead and puts into appropriations bills unrequested and unnecessary spending, let the President put a line through that, send it back to the Congress and let the Congress vote on it again.
Congress has to help out in reducing this budget deficit as much as the Executive Branch.
Tom Brokaw, a last question for Senator Bentsen.
Senator Bentsen, I'd like to ask you about your split personality during this election year.
You're running on the ticket with Michael Dukakis, a man who is opposed to the death penalty, a man who is in favor of gun control, and at the same time you're running for the United States Senate in the state of Texas, where your position on many of those same issues is well known, and absolutely opposed to him.
How do you explain to the people of Texas how you can be a social conservative on those cutting issues and still run with Michael Dukakis on the national ticket?
Michael Dukakis wasn't looking for a clone.
I think it's part of the strength and the character of this land that he reaches out, and that he wants someone that will speak up - and that I'll do.
I've seen many chief executives come into my office and say they're going over and tell the president of the United States off, they're going to pound the desk, and go into that office and turn to Jello.
Now, I've dealt with many a president, and I don't hesitate for a minute to speak up.
But when you're talking about something like the death penalty, where Michael Dukakis and I do disagree, what you really ought to get to is what's being done against crime, and what kind of progress he's been able to make.
In the state of Massachusetts he has the homicide rate down to the lowest of any industrial state.
It's substantially ahead of the national average.
He's been able to do that with an educated program for the people of that state by adding some 1,500 new police officers; he's done it in turn by the leadership that I think he will bring to the ticket when he becomes president of the United States
