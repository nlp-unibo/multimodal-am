But my big difference with this Administration is, they look at the contra aid program as the only way to resolve that problem.
They concentrate on that.
And I really think we have to give peace a chance.
And that's why I have been a strong supporter of the Arias plan, a plan that won the Nobel Prize for President Arias, the President of Costa Rica.
I believe you have to work with the leaders of those other Central American countries to try to bring about the democratization of Nicaragua - by negotiation, by pressure, by counseling, by diplomatic pressure, that we ought to be trying that first.
But in concentrating so much just on the Contras, this Administration has not paid enough attention to the rest of Central America.
The concern I have is that we have a country with 85 million people sharing a 2,000mile border with us, with half of those people under the age of 15, a country that's had its standard of living cut 50 percent in the last six years.
Now we ought to be concerned about that, and we ought to be involved.
I was born and reared on that Mexican border.
I speak their language.
I've spent a good part of my life down there.
Gov.
Dukakis speaks Spanish, too.
He's spent a good deal of time in Central and South America.
And we believe that we ought to be working with a new Alliance for Progress, bringing in other countries to help; bring in Europeans, the Spanish, who have a real affinity for that area; bringing in the Japanese who have a great surplus now and looking for places to invest it.
Those are the positive things I think we could do to bring about peace in that area, to help raise that standard of living and give them the kind of stability where democracy can proceed and can prosper and bloom.
Those are the kinds of things that we'd be committed to in a Dukakis-Bentsen Administration to try to make this world a better place in which to live.
Senator Quayle, your response.
There's no doubt in a Dukakis Administration that the aid would be cut off to the democratic resistance in Nicaragua, and that is unfortunate.
The reason it is unfortunate, because it is beyond me why it's okay for the Soviet Union to put in billions of dollars to prop up the communist Sandinistas, but somehow it's wrong for the United States to give a few dollars to the democratic resistance.
There's a thing called the Monroe Doctrine, something that the Governor of Massachusetts has said has been superseded.
I doubt if many Americans agree with that.
I think they believe in the Monroe Doctrine.
Senator Bentsen talked about the entire Central America.
There's another issue that Michael Dukakis is wrong on in Central America, and that's Grenada.
He criticized our rescue mission in Grenada, according to a UPI report.
Criticized that, yet 85 percent of the American people supported our rescue mission, and we turned a communist country into a noncommunist country.
The Governor of Massachusetts is simply out of step with mainstream America.
Brit Hume, a question for Senator Bentsen.
Good evening, Senator Bentsen, Senator Quayle.
I'm sort of the cleanup man in this order, and I've been asked by my colleagues to try to deal with anything that's been left on base.
Senator, I have a follow up question for you, Senator Quayle.
But Senator Bentsen, I first want to ask you a question about PAC money, a thing I'm sure you're prepared to talk about.
Gov.
Dukakis has tried to make ethics a major issue in the campaign.
And he has you as a running mate, a man who leads the league at last count in the receipt of PAC money, that being the money raised by the special interest organizations.
That is a kind of campaign financing which Gov.
Dukakis finds so distasteful that he has refused to accept any of it.
Do you find that embarrassing, Senator?
No, I don't find it embarrassing at all.
Because you have to remember that PAC money is the result of the last campaign reform bill, one that talks about employees have greater participation.
And what I've done in PAC money is just what my opponent in my campaign has done in his campaign.
He has been raising PAC money, too.
So what you have to do is comply with the laws as they are, whether you're paying taxes or you're playing a football game.
Whether you like those laws or not, you comply with them.
Now, I have been for campaign reform, and have pushed it very hard.
I believe that we have to do some things in that regard.
But I've noticed that the Senator from Indiana has opposed that campaign reform and voted repeatedly against it.
The things we have to do, I believe, that will cut back on soft money, for example, which I look on as frankly one of those things that we've had to do because the Republicans have done it for so long.
But I think it's a loophole, frankly.
But campaign reform, changing the rules of the game, is something we tried repeatedly in this session of the Congress, but only to have the Republicans lead the charge against us and defeat us.
And I wish that Senator Quayle would change his mind on that particular piece of legislation and give us the kind of a campaign reform law that I think is needed in America.
Senator Quayle, your response.
Senator Bentsen is the number one PAC raiser.
As a matter of fact, he used to have a $10,000 breakfast club.
$10,000 breakfast club.
It only costs high paid lobbyists, special interests in Washington, to come down and have breakfast with the Chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, the one that oversees all the tax loopholes in the tax code, $10,000.
I'm sure they weren't paying to have cornflakes.
Well, I'll tell you the kind of campaign reform I'm supporting, Senator Bentsen.
I think it's time we get rid of PAC money.
Support our legislation where we totally eliminate contributions by special interests and political action committees, and let's have the individual contribute and the political parties contribute.
That's the kind of campaign reform that Republicans are for.
They want to get rid of this special interest and rely on the individuals, and also, the political parties.
Brit, your question for Senator Quayle.
Once again, let me caution the audience: please, keep your reactions as quiet as possible.
Brit?
Senator, I want to take you back if I can to the question Judy asked you about some of the apprehensions people may feel about your being a heart beat away from the presidency.
And let us assume if we can for the sake of this question that you have become Vice President and the President is incapacitated for one reason or another, and you have to take the reins of power.
When that moment came, what would be the first steps that you'd take, and why?
First - first, I'd say a prayer for myself and for the country that I'm about to lead.
And then I would assemble his people and talk.
And I think this question keeps going back to the qualifications and what kind of Vice President in this hypothetical situation, if I had to assume the responsibilities of President, what I would be.
And as I have said, age alone, although I can tell you, after the experiences of these last few week in the campaign, I've added ten years to my age, age alone is not the only qualification.
You've got to look at experience, and you've got to look at accomplishments, and can you make a difference.
Have I made a difference in the United States Senate where I've served for eight years?
Yes, I have.
Have I made a difference in the Congress that I've served for 12 years?
Yes, I have.
As I said before, looking at the issue of qualifications - and I am delighted that it comes up, because on the three most important challenges facing America, arms control and national security, jobs and education and budget deficit, I have more experience and accomplishments than does the Governor of Massachusetts.
I have been in the Congress and I've worked on these issues.
And believe me, when you look at arms control and trying to deal with the Soviet Union, you cannot come at it from a naive position.
You have to understand the Soviet Union.
You have to understand how they will respond.
Sitting on that Senate Armed Services Committee for eight years has given me the experience to deal with the Soviet Union and how we can move forward.
That is just one of the troubling issues that's going to be facing this nation, and I'm prepared.
Senator Bentsen.
Well, I can't leave something on the table that he's charged me with, and so let's get to that one.
When you talk about the breakfast club, as you know, that was perfectly legal.
And I formed it, and I closed it down almost immediately because I thought the perception was bad.
But it's the same law - it's the same law - that lets you invite high priced lobbyists down to Williamsburg.
And bring them down there and entertain them playing golf, playing tennis, and bringing Republican Senators down there, to have exchanged for that contributions to their campaign.
It's the same kind of law that lets you have honorariums - and you've collected over a quarter of a million dollars of honorariums now, speaking to various interest groups.
And there's no control over what you do with that money.
You can spend it on anything you want to.
You can spent it on golf club dues, if you want to do that.
(Applause)
Now, that's what I've seen you do in this Administration.
And that's why we need campaign reform laws, and why I support them.
And you in turn have voted against them time and time again.
(Applause)
John Margolis, question for Senator Quayle.
Senator Quayle, in recent years the Reagan administration has scaled back the activities of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, prompted in part by Vice President Bush's Task Force on Regulatory Relief.
The budget for the agency has been cut by 20 percent and the number of inspections and manufacturing plants has been reduced by 33 percent.
This has had a special effect in this area where many people work in the meat packing industry, which has a far higher rate of serious injuries than almost any other injury, a rate which appears to have been rising, although we're not really sure, because some of the largest companies have allegedly falsifying their reports.
Would you acknowledge to the hundreds of injured and maimed people Nebraska, Iowa and elsewhere in the Midwest that in this case deregulation may have gone too far and the government should reassert itself in protecting workers' rights.
The premise of your question, John, is that somehow this administration has been lax in enforcement of the OSHA regulations.
And I disagree with that.
And I'll tell you why.
If you want to ask some business people that I talk to periodically, they complain about the tough enforcement of this administration and, furthermore, let me tell you this for the record, when we have found violations in this administration, there has not only been tough enforcement, but there have been the most severe penalties - the largest penalties in the history of the Department of Labor - have been levied when these violations have been found.
There is a commitment and there will always be a commitment to the safety of our working men and women.
They deserve it and we're committed to them.
Now, the broader question goes to the whole issue of deregulation and has deregulation worked or has deregulation not worked.
In my judgment deregulation has worked.
We have a deregulated economy and we have produced through low taxes, not high taxes, through deregulation - the spirit of entrepreneurship, the individual going out and starting a business, the businessman or women willing to go out and risk their investments to start up a business and hire people.
We have produced 17 million jobs in this country since 1982.
Deregulation as a form of political philosophy is a good philosophy.
It's one that our opponents disagree with.
They want a centralized government.
But we believe in the market, we believe in the people and yes, there's a role of government and the role of government is to make sure that those safety - and health and the welfare of the people is taken care of.
And we'll continue to do that.
Senator Bentsen?
Well, I think you see once again a piece of Democratic legislation that's been passed to try protect the working men and women of America.
And then you've seen an administration that came in and really didn't have it's heart in that kind of an enforcement.
A good example of that is the environmental protection laws that we were talking about a moment ago.
This administration came in and put in a James Watt, an Ann Gorsuch, now that's the Bonnie and Clyde, really, of environmental protection.
And that's why it's important that you have people that truly believe and trying to represent the working men and women of America.
Most employers do a good job of that, but some of them put their profits before people and that's why you have to have OSHA and that's why you have to have tough and good and fair enforcement of it and that's what a Democratic administration would do to help make this working place a safer and better place to be employed.
John Margolis, another question for Senator Bentsen.
Senator Bentsen, since you have been in the Senate, the government has spent increasing amounts of money in an effort to protect the family farmer.
Though most of the subsidies seem to go - do go to the largest and richest farmers who presumably need it least, while it's the smaller farmers who are often forced to sell out, sometimes to their large farmer neighbor who's gotten more subsidies to begin with.
Despite the fact that I believe you, sir, are a rather large farmer, yourself, do you believe that it's time to uncouple the subsidy formula from the amount of land the farmer has and target Federal money to the small and medium size farmer?
Well, I've supported that.
I voted for the 50,000 limitation to get away from the million dollar contributions to farmer.
You know, of the four that are on this ticket, I'm the only on that was born and reared on a farm and still involved in farming, so I think I understand their concerns and their problems.
Now, I feel very strongly that we ought to be doing more for the American farmer and what we've seen under this administration is neglect of that farmer.
We've seen them drive 220,000 farmers off the farm.
They seem to think the answer is move them to town, but we ought not to be doing that.
What you have seen them do is cut the farm assistance for the rural areas by over 50 percent.
We're seeing rural hospitals close all over the country because of this kind of an administration.
We've seen an administration that has lost much of our market abroad, because they have not had a trade policy.
We saw our market loss by some 40 percent.
And that's one of the reasons that we've seen the cost of the farm program, which was only about two and a half billion dollars when they took office, now go to about $25 billion.
Now, we can bring that kind of a cost down and get more to market prices if we'll have a good trade policy.
I was in January visiting with Mr. Takeshita, the new Prime Minister of Japan.
I said, "You're paying five times as much for beef as we pay for our in country - pay for it in our country, six times as much for rice.
You have a $60 billion trade surplus with us.
You could improve the standard of living of your people.
You're spending 27 percent of your disposable income.
We spend 14 or 15 percent."
"When you have that kind of barrier up against us, that's not free and fair trade and we don't believe that should continue."
We would be pushing very hard to open up those markets and stand up for the American farmer and see that we recapture those foreign markets and I think we can do it with the Dukakis-Bentsen administration.
Senator Quayle?
Senator Bentsen talks about recapturing the foreign markets.
Well, I'll tell you one way that we're not going to recapture the foreign markets and that is if, in fact, we have another Jimmy Carter grain embargo.
(Equal amounts of cheering and booing) Jimmy Carter - Jimmy Carter grain embargo set the American farmer back.
You know what the farmer's interested in?
Net farm income.
Every one percent in increase in interest rates, a billion dollars out of the farmer's pocket.
Net farm income, increased inflation, another billion dollars.
Another thing that a farmer is not interested in and that's supply management that the Democratic platform talks about.
But the Governor of Massachusetts, he has a farm program.
He went to the farmers in the Midwest and told them not to grow corn, not to grow soybeans, but to grow Belgium [sic] endive.
That's what his - that's what he and his Harvard buddies think of the American farmer, grow Belgium endive.
To come in and to tell our farmers not to grow corn, not to grow soybeans, that's the kind of farm policy you'll get under a Dukakis administration and one I think the American farmer rightfully will reject.
Tom Brokaw, a question for Senator Bentsen.
Senator Bentsen, you were a businessman before you entered the U.S. Senate.
Let me offer you an inventory if I may: Lower interest rates, lower unemployment, lower inflation and an arms control deal with the Soviet Union.
Now two guys come through your door at your business and say, "We'd like you to change," without offering a lot of specifics.
Why would you accept their deal?
You know, if you let me write $200 billion worth of hot checks every year, I could give you an illusion of prosperity, too.
(Laughter and applause) This is an administration that has more than doubled the national debt, and they've done that in less than eight years.
They have taken this country from the No.
1 lender nation in the world to the No.
1 debtor nation in the world.
And the interest on that debt next year, on this Reagan-Bush debt of our nation, is going to be $640 for every man, woman, and child in America because of this kind of a credit-card mentality.
So we go out and we try to sell our securities every week, and hope that the foreigners will buy them.
And they do buy them.
But every time they do, we lose some of our economic independence for the future.
Now they've turned around and they've bought 10 percent of the manufacturing base of this country.
They bought 20 percent of the banks.
They own 46 percent of the commercial real estate in Los Angeles.
They are buying America on the cheap.
Now, when we have other countries that can't manage their economy down in Central and South America, we send down the American ambassador, we send down the International Monetary Fund, and we tell them what they can buy and what they can sell and how to run their economies.
The ultimate irony would be to have that happen to us, because foreigners finally quit buying our securities.
So what we need in this country is someone like Mike Dukakis, who gave ten balanced budgets in a row there, and was able to do that, meet that kind of a commitment, set those tough priorities.
We need an administration that will turn this trade policy around and open up those markets, stand tough with our trading partners to help
