keep the jobs at home and send the products abroad.
Senator Quayle.
Senator Bentsen talks about running up the debt.
Well, the governor of Massachusetts has run up more debt than all the governors in the history of Massachusetts combined, going back to the days of the Pilgrims.
I don't believe that that's the kind of policy that we want.
The question went to the heart of the matter, Tom.
You asked the question why would we change.
Well, we have changed since 1980.
We've got interest rates down, we've got inflation down, people are working again, America is held in respect once again around the world.
But we are going to build on that change.
And as we made those positive changes of lower interest rates, lower rate of inflation, the governor of Massachusetts fought us every step of the way.
We are proud of the record of accomplishment and the opportunities and the hope for millions of Americans.
Hope and opportunity of these Americans is because of the policies that we have had for the last eight years, and we want to build on that and change it for even the better.
Tom, a question for Senator Quayle.
Senator Quayle, as you mentioned here tonight, you actively supported the invasion of Grenada, which was a military operation to rescue some American medical students and to rescue an island from a Marxist takeover.
If military force was necessary in that endeavor, why not use the military to go after the South American drug cartels and after General Noriega, for that matter, in a surgical strike, since drugs in the minds of most Americans pose a far greater danger to many more people?
(Scattered applause)
You are absolutely right that the drug problem is the No.
1 issue.
But would you please address the military aspect of it.
I will address the military aspect, if I may respond.
The military aspect of the drug problem is being addressed.
As a matter of fact, we are using the Department of Defense in a coordinated effort, in reconnaissance.
But I don't believe that we are going to turn the Department of Defense into a police organization.
We are using our military assets in a prudent way to deal with interdiction, and we've made some success in this area.
Seventy tons of cocaine have been stopped.
But, you know, when you look at the drug problem - and it is a tremendous problem, and there are no easy solutions to it - it's a complicated problem, and it's heading up the effort to try to create a drug-free America, which is a challenge and a goal of all of us.
Not only will we utilize national defense and the Department of Defense, but we've got to get on the demand side of the ledger; we've got to get to education.
And education ought to begin at home, and it ought to be reinforced in our schools.
And there's another thing that will be more important than the premise of this question on a hypothetical of using troops.
We will use the military assets, we will use military assets - but we need to focus on another part of this problem, and that problem is law enforcement.
And here is where we have a major disagreement with the governor of Massachusetts.
He is opposed to the death penalty for drug kingpins.
We believe people convicted of that crime deserve the death penalty, as does the legislation that's in the Congress that is supported by a bipartisan, including many Democrats of his party.
He also was opposed to mandatory drug sentencing for drug dealers in the state of Massachusetts.
You cannot have a war on drugs, you cannot be tough on drugs and weak on crime.
Senator Bentsen.
It's interesting to see that the Senator from Indiana, when we had a resolution on the floor of the United States Senate sponsored by Senator Dole, that this government would make no deal with Noriega - that the Senator from Indiana was one of the dozen senators that voted against it.
It's also interesting to see that one of his campaign managers that's trying to help him with his image was also hired by Noriega to help him with his image in Panama.
(Shouts and applause) What we have seen under this administration - we have seen them using eight cabinet officers, twenty-eight different agencies, all fighting over turf - and that is one thing we would correct under a Dukakis-Bentsen administration.
We would put one person in charge in the war against drugs, and we would commit the resources to get that job done.
Now, Mike Dukakis has been able to do that type of thing in the state of Massachusetts by cutting the drug use in the high schools while it's going up around the rest of the country, by putting in a drug educational program that the Drug Enforcement Agency said was a model to the country.
We would be doing that around the rest of the country.
That's a positive attack against drugs.
Brit Hume, a question for Senator Quayle.
Senator, I want to take you back to the question that I asked you earlier about what would happen if you were to take over in an emergency, and what you would do first and why.
You said you would say a prayer, and you said something about a meeting.
What would you do next?
(Laughter)
I don't believe that it's proper for me to get into the specifics of a hypothetical situation like that.
The situation is that if I was called upon to serve as the president of this country, or the responsibilities of the president of this country, would I be capable and qualified to do that?
And I've tried to list the qualifications of twelve years in the United States Congress.
I have served in the Congress for twelve years; I have served in the Congress and served eight years on the Senate Armed Services Committee.
I have traveled a number of times - I've been to Geneva many times to meet with our negotiators as we were hammering out the INF Treaty; I've met with the western political leaders - Margaret Thatcher, Chancellor Kohl - I know them, they know me.
I know what it takes to lead this country forward.
And if that situation arises, yes, I will be prepared, and I will be prepared to lead this country, if that happens.
(Applause)
Senator Bentsen.
Once again I think what we are looking at here is someone that can step in at the presidency level at the moment, if that tragedy would occur.
And if that's the case, again you have to look at maturity of judgment, and you have to look at breadth of experience.
You have to see what kind of leadership roles that person has played in his life before that crisis struck him.
And if you do that type of thing, then you arrive at a judgment that I think would be a wise one.
And I hope that would mean that you would say we are going to vote for Mike Dukakis and Lloyd Bentsen.
(Applause)
Brit, question for Senator Bentsen.
Senator, I want to take you back if I can to the celebrated Breakfast Club, when it was first revealed that you had a plan to have people pay $10,000 a plate to have breakfast with you.
You handled it with disarming, not to say charming, candor, you said it was a mistake, and you disbanded it and called the whole idea off.
And you were widely praised for having handled it deftly.
The question I have is: If The Washington Post had not broken that story and other media picked up on it, what can you tell us tonight as to why we should not believe that you would still be having those breakfasts to this day?
(Scattered laughter)
I really must say, Brit, I don't make many mistakes, but that one was a real doozy.
And I agree with that.
And, as you know, I immediately disbanded it.
It was perfectly legal.
And you have all kinds of such clubs on the Hill - and you know that.
But I still believe that the better way to go is to have a campaign reform law that takes care of that kind of a situation.
Even though it's legal, the perception is bad.
So I would push very strong to see that we reform the entire situation.
I'd work for that end, and that's what my friend from Indiana has opposed repeatedly, vote after vote.
Senator Quayle.
He disbanded the club, but he's still got the money.
He is the number one - he is the number one receiver of political action committee money.
Now, Senator Bentsen has talked about reform.
Well, let me tell you about the reform that we're pushing.
Let's eliminate political action committees, the special interest money.
There's legislation before the Congress to do that.
That way, we won't have to worry about breakfast clubs, or who's the number one PAC raiser.
We can go back and get the contributions from the working men and women and the individuals of America.
We can also strengthen our two party system - and it needs strengthening - and rely more on the political parties than we have in the past.
That's the kind of campaign reform that I'm for, and I hope the Senator will join me.
John Margolis, a question for Senator Bentsen.
Senator, we've all just finished - most America has just finished one of the hottest summers it can remember.
And apparently this year will be the fifth out of the last nine that are among the hottest on record.
No one knows, but most scientists think, that something we're doing, human beings are doing, are exacerbating this problem, and that this could, in a couple of generations, threaten our descendants comfort and health and perhaps even their existence.
As Vice President what would you urge our government to do to deal with this problem?
And specifically as a Texan, could you support a substantial reduction in the use of fossil fuels which might be necessary down the road?
Well, I think what you can do in that one, and which would be very helpful, is to use a lot more natural gas, which burns a lot cleaner.
And what Mike Dukakis has said is that he'll try to break down those regulatory roadblocks that you have in the regulatory agency that denies much of the passage of that natural gas to the northeast, a way, in turn, can fight against acid rain which is another threat, because it's sterilizing our lakes, it's killing our fish.
And it's interesting to me to see in the resume of Senator Quayle that he brags on the fact that he's been able to fight the acid rain legislation.
I don't think that that's a proper objective in trying to clean up this environment.
But the greenhouse effect is one that has to be a threat to all of us, and we have to look for alternative sources of fuel.
And I've supported that very strongly.
The Department of Energy is one that has cut back substantially on the study of those alternative sources of fuels.
We can use other things that'll help the farmer.
We can convert corn to ethanol, and I would push for that very strong.
So absolutely.
I'll do those things that are necessary to put the environment of our country number one.
Because if we don't protect that, we'll destroy the future of our children.
And we must be committed to trying - to clean up the water, clean up the air, and do everything we can, not only from a research standpoint, but also in the applied legislation to see that that's carried out.
Senator Quayle?
Vice President George Bush has said that he will take on the environmental problem.
He has said further that he will deal with the acid rain legislation and reduce millions of tons of the S02 content.
That legislation won't get through the Congress this year.
But it will get through in a George Bush Administration, a George Bush Administration that is committed to the environment.
Now the greenhouse effect is an important environmental issue.
It is important for us to get the data in, to see what alternatives we might have to the fossil fuels, and make sure we know what we're doing.
And there are some explorations and things that we can consider in this area.
The drought highlighted the problem that we have, and therefore, we need to get on with it, and in a George Bush Administration, you can bet that we will.
John, a question for Senator Quayle.
Senator, as Vice President your most important contribution would be the advice you gave the President.
One of the most troubling facts that's going to face the new Administration is the fact that the United States has now become the world's largest debtor nation.
In 1987 foreigners underwrote our debts to the tune of about $138 billion.
Last week a top official of the Japanese Economic Planning Agency bragged that Japan now is in a position to influence the value of the dollar, of our interest rates, and even our stock prices.
And he warned that one day maybe they'd do just that.
If you were Vice President of the United States and Japan did that, what would you tell the President to do?
When you look at dealing with this total problem - i t's not just with the Japanese, but the underlying question on this total world debt problem - you have got to see, why are we a debtor, and what is attracting the foreign investment into our country today, whether it's Japanese or others.
I would rather have people come over here and to make investments in this country, rather than going elsewhere.
Because by coming over here, and making investments in this country, we are seeing jobs.
Do you realize that today we are producing Hondas and exporting Hondas to Japan?
We are the envy of the world.
The United States - (Laughter)
Some of Senator Bentsen's supporters laugh at that.
They laugh at that because they don't believe that the United States of America is the envy of the world.
Well, I can tell you, the American people think the United States of America is the envy of the world.
(Applause)
Senator - oh, I'm sorry, go ahead.
We are the greatest nation in this world, and the greatest economic power.
Now, there's been some talk in Congress about forgiveness of debt.
Forgiveness of debt is wrong.
Forgiveness of international debt would be counterproductive.
And I would like to see those that talk about forgiving debt, Senator Bentsen, go out and talk about a farmer that's in debt that doesn't have his forgiven.
That's not the kind of policy George Bush will have.
Senator Bentsen.
Well, I've told you what I'd do about trade and trying to help turn that situation around.
But what we also should do is get them to give us more burden sharing when it comes to national defense.
We have a situation today where, on a per capita basis, people in Western Europe are spending about one-third as much as we are in our country.
And then when you go to Japan, where we're spending 6-1/2 percent on defense of the democracies, they're spending one percent.
I met with some of the Japanese business leaders, talking to them about it.
And I said, you know, we have 50,000 troops here in Japan, protecting the democracies of Asia.
And it costs $3.5 billion a year.
You're the number two economic power in the world.
You ought to measure up to that responsibility and carry some of that cost.
I said, if we were not doing what we're doing, we'd have a big budget surplus.
And I said, you'd have chaos, because you get 55 percent of your oil from the Persian Gulf, and you wouldn't have the U.S. Navy down there to take care of that.
Now, the Senator from Indiana, when we passed a resolution in the United States Senate to ask for burden sharing on that cost to keep those sea lanes open from the Japanese, he votes against that.
I don't understand that.
Tom Brokaw, a question for Senator Quayle.
Senator Quayle, I don't mean to beat this drum until it has no more sound in it.
But to follow up on Brit Hume's question, when you said that it was a hypothetical situation, it is, sir, after all, the reason that we're here tonight, because you are running not just for Vice President - (Applause)
And if you cite the experience that you had in Congress, surely you must have some plan in mind about what you would do if it fell to you to become President of the United States, as it has to so many Vice Presidents just in the last 25 years or so.
Let me try to answer the question one more time.
I think this is the fourth time that I've had this question.
The third time.
Three times that I've had this question - and I will try to answer it again for you, as clearly as I can, because the question you are asking is what kind of qualifications does Dan Quayle have to be president, what kind of qualifications do I have and what would I do in this kind of a situation.
And what would I do in this situation?
I would make sure that the people in the cabinet and the people that are advisors to the president are called in, and I would talk to them, and I will work with them.
And I will know them on a firsthand basis, because as vice president I will sit on the National Security Council.
And I will know them on a firsthand basis, because I'm going to be coordinating the drug effort.
I will know them on a firsthand basis because Vice President George Bush is going to recreate the Space Council, and I will be in charge of that.
I will have day-to-day activities with all the people in government.
And then, if that unfortunate situation happens - if that situation, which would be very tragic, happens, I will be prepared to carry out the responsibilities of the presidency of the United States of America.
And I will be prepared to do that.
I will be prepared not only because of my service in the Congress, but because of my ability to communicate and to lead.
It is not just age; it's accomplishments, it's experience.
I have far more experience than many others that sought the office of vice president of this country.
I have as much experience in the Congress as Jack Kennedy did when he sought the presidency.
I will be prepared to deal with the people in the Bush administration, if that unfortunate event would ever occur.
Senator Bentsen.
Senator, I served with Jack Kennedy, I knew Jack Kennedy, Jack Kennedy was a friend of mine.
Senator, you are no Jack Kennedy.
(Prolonged shouts and applause) What has to be done in a situation like that is to call in the -
Please, please, once again you are only taking time away from your own candidate.
That was really uncalled for, Senator.
(Shouts and applause)
You are the one that was making the comparison, Senator - and I'm one who knew him well.
And frankly I think you are so far apart in the objectives you choose for your country that I did not think the comparison was well-taken.
Tom, a question for Senator Bentsen.
Since you seem to be taking no hostages on the stage, let me ask you a question - (Laughter) - about the American hostages, nine, still in brutal captivity in the Middle East.
Senator Bentsen, you have been critical of the
