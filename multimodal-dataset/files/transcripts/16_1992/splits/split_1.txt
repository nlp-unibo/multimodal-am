role in Europe.
We certainly must maintain an engagement there.
There are certainly dangers there, there are certainly other trouble spots in the world which are closer to Europe than to the US.
But 2 former defense secretaries recently issued a report saying that 100,000 or slightly fewer troops would be enough, including President Reagan's former defense secretary, Mr. Carlucci.
Many of the military experts whom I consulted on this agreed.
We're going to have to spend more money in the future on military technology and on greater mobility, greater airlift, greater sealift, the B-22 airplane.
We're going to have to do some things that are quite costly.
And I simply don't believe we can afford nor do we need to keep 150,000 troops in Europe given how much the Red Army, now under the control of Russia, has been cut, the arms control agreement concluded between Mr. Bush and Mr. Yeltsin, something I have applauded.
I don't think we need 150,000 troops.
Let me make one other point.
Mr. Bush talked about taxes.
He didn't tell you that he vetoed a middle class tax cut because it would be paid for by raising taxes on the wealthy and vetoed an investment tax credit paid for by raising taxes on the wealthy.
All right.
We go now to Mr. Perot for a 2-minute question, and it will be asked by John Mashek.
Mr Perot, you talked about fairness just a minute ago and sharing the pain.
As part of your plan to reduce the ballooning federal deficit, you've suggested that we raise gasoline taxes 50 cents a gallon over 5 years.
Why punish the middle class consumer to such a degree?
It's 10 cents a year cumulative.
It finally gets to 50 cents at the end of the 5th year.
I think "punish" is the wrong word.
Again, see, I didn't create this problem.
We're trying to solve it.
Now, if you study our international competitors, some of our international competitors collect up to $3.50 a gallon in taxes, and they use that money to build infrastructure and to create jobs.
We collect 35 cents, and we don't have it to spend.
I know it's not popular, and I understand the nature of your question.
But the people who will be helped the most by it are the working people who will get the jobs created because of this tax.
Why do we have to do it?
Because we have so mismanaged our country over the years, and it is now time to pay the fiddler.
And if we don't, we will be spending our children's money.
We have spent $4 trillion worth.
An incredible number of young people are active in supporting my effort because they are deeply concerned that we have taken the American dream from them.
I think it's fitting that we're on the campus of a university tonight.
These young people, when they get out of this wonderful university, will have difficulty finding a job.
We've got to clean this mess up, leave this country in good shape, and pass on the American dream to them.
We've got to collect the taxes to do it.
If there's a fairer way, I'm all ears (laughter) --aah.
(Laughter and applause) But--but--see, let me make it very clear.
If people don't have the stomach to fix these problems, I think it's a good time to face it, November.
If they do, then they will have heard the harsh reality of what we have to do.
I'm not playing Lawrence Welk music tonight.
All right, Governor Clinton, you have a minute, sir.
I think Mr. Perot has confronted this deficit issue, but I think it's important to point out that we really have 2 deficits in America, not one.
We have a budget deficit in the federal government, but we also have an investment, a jobs, an income deficit.
People are working harder for less money than they were making 10 years ago, 2- 3rds of our people--a $1600 drop in average income in just the last 2 years.
The problem I have with the Perot prescription is that almost all economists who've looked at it say that if you cut the deficit this much this quick it will increase unemployment, it will slow down the economy.
That's why I think we shouldn't do it that quickly.
We have a disciplined reduction in the deficit of 50 % over the next 4 years, but first get incentives to invest in this economy, put the American people back to work.
We've got to invest and grow.
9 Nobel Prize-winning economists and 500 others, including numerous Republican and Democratic business executives, have endorsed this approach because it offers the best hope to put America back to work and get our incomes rising instead of falling.
President Bush, one minute, sir.
Your question was on fairness.
I just disagree with Mr. Perot.
I don't believe it is fair to slap a 50-cent-a-gallon tax over whatever many years on the people that have to drive for a living, people that go long distances.
I don't think we need to do it.
You see, I have a fundamental difference.
I agree with what he's talking about in trying to get this spending down and the discipline, although I think we ought to totally exempt Social Security.
But he's talking tough medicine, and I think that's good.
I disagree with the tax-and-spend philosophy.
You see, I don't think we need to tax more and spend more, and then say that's going to make the problem better.
And I'm afraid that's what I think I'm hearing from Governor Clinton.
I believe what you need to do is some of what Ross is talking about: control the growth of mandatory spending and get taxes down.
He's mentioned some ways to do it--and I agree with those.
I've been talking about getting a capital gains cut forever, and his friends in Congress have been telling me that's a tax break for the rich.
It would stimulate investment.
I'm for an investment tax allowance; I'm for a tax break for first- time homebuyers.
And with this new Congress coming in, gridlock will be gone, and I'll sit down with them and say let's get this done.
But I do not want to go the tax-and-spend route.
All right, let's move on now to the subject of jobs.
The first question goes to President Bush for 2 minutes, and John will ask that question.
Mr. President, last month you came to St. Louis to announce a very lucrative contract for McDonnell Douglas to build F-15s for Saudi Arabia.
In today's Post- Dispatch, a retired saleswoman, a 75-year-old woman named Marjorie Roberts, asked if she could ask a question of the candidates.
She said she wanted to register her concern about the lack of a plan to convert our defense-oriented industries into other purposes.
How would you answer her.
I assume she was supportive of the decision on McDonnell Douglas, I assume she was supporting me on the decision to sell those airplanes.
I think it's a good decision--took a little heat for it, but I think it was the correct decision to do.
And we worked it out, and indeed we're moving forward all around the world in a much more peaceful way.
So that one we came away with in creating jobs for the American people.
I would simply say to her, look, take a look at what the president has proposed on job retraining.
When you cut back on defense spending, some people are going to be thrown out of work.
If you throw another 50,000 kids on the street because of cutting recklessly in troop levels, you're going to put a lot more out of work.
I would say to them, look at the job retraining programs that we're proposing.
Therein is the best answer to her.
And another one is: stimulate investment and savings.
I mean, we've got big economic problems, but we are not coming apart at the seams; we're ready for a recovery.
With interest rates down and inflation down, the cruelest tax of all, caught up in a global slowdown right now, that that will change if you go with the programs I've talked about and if you help with job retraining and education.
I am a firm believer that our America 2000 education problem is the answer--a little longer run; it's going to take awhile to educate.
But it is a good program.
So her best help for short term is job retraining, if she was thrown out of work at a defense plant.
But tell her it's not all that gloomy; we're the US, we faced tough problems before.
Look at the misery index when the Democrats had both the White House and the Congress.
It was just right through the roof.
Now, we can do better.
And the way to do better is not to tax and spend but to retrain, get that control of the mandatory spending programs.
I'm much more optimistic about this country than some.
(APPLAUSE)
Mr. Perot?
Mr. Perot, you have one minute, sir.
Defense industries are going to have to convert to civilian industries.
Many of them are.
And the sooner they start, the sooner they'll finish.
And there will be a significant transition.
And it's very important that we not continue to let our industrial base deteriorate.
We had someone who I'm sure regrets said it in the president's staff said he didn't care whether we made potato chips or computer chips.
Well, anybody that thinks about it cares a great deal.
Number one, you make more making computer chips than potato chips; and, number 2, 19 out of 20 computer chips that we have in this country now come from Japan.
We've given away whole industries.
So as we phase these industries over, there's a whole of intellectual talent in these industries.
A lot of these people in industries can be converted to the industries of tomorrow, and that's where the high-paying jobs are.
We need to have a very carefully thought through phase-over.
Now, see, we practice 19th century capitalism.
The rest of the world practices 21st century capitalism.
I can't handle that in a minute, but I hope we can get back into it later.
In the rest of the world, the countries and the businesses would be working together to make this transition in an intelligent way.
Governor Clinton, you have one minute, sir.
We must have a transition plan to plan to convert from a defense to a domestic economy.
No other nation would have cut defense as much as we already have without that.
There are 200,000 people unemployed in California alone because we have cut defense without planning to retrain them and to reinvest in the technologies of the future here at home.
That is what I want to do.
This administration may say they have a plan, but the truth is they have not even released all the money, the paltry sum of money, that Congress appropriated.
I want to take very dollar by which we reduce defense and reinvest it in technologies for the 21st century--in new transportation, in communication, in environmental clean-up technologies.
Let's put the American people to work, and let's build the kind of high-tech, high-wage, high-growth economy that the American people deserve.
All right.
The next question goes to Mr. Perot for a 2-minute answer.
It will be asked by Ann.
Ann?
Mr. Perot, you talked a minute ago about rebuilding the job base.
But is it true what Governor Clinton just said, that that means that unemployment will increase, that it will slow the economy?
And how would you specifically use the powers of the presidency to get more people back into good jobs immediately?
Step one, the American people send me up there, the day after election, I'll get with congressional--we won't even wait till inauguration, and I'll ask the president to help me and I'll ask his staff to help me.
And we will start putting together teams to put together--to take all the plans that exist and do something with them.
Please understand.
There are great plans lying all over Washington nobody ever executes.
It's like having a blueprint for a house you never built.
You don't have anywhere to sleep.
Now our challenge is to take these things, do something with them.
Step one, we want to put America back to work, clean up the small business problem, have one task force at work on that.
The second, you've got your big companies that are in trouble, including the defense industries--have another one on that.
Have a 3rd task force on new industries of the future to make sure we nail those for our country and they don't wind up in Europe and Asia.
Convert from 19th to 21st century capitalism.
See, we have an adversarial relationship between government and business.
Our international competitors that are cleaning our plate have an intelligent relationship between government and business, and a supportive relationship.
Then have another task force on crime because, next to jobs, our people are concerned about their safety.
Health care, schools--one on the debt and deficit.
And finally in that 90- day period before the inauguration, put together the framework for the town hall and give the American people a Christmas present.
Show them by Christmas the first cut at these plans.
By the time Congress comes into session to go to work, have those plans ready to go in front of Congress.
Then get off to a flying start in '93 to execute these plans.
Now, there are people in this room and people on this stage who've been in meetings when I would sit there and say, "Is this the one we're going to talk about or do something about?"
Well, obviously, my orientation is let's go do it.
Now, put together your plans by Christmas, be ready to go when Congress goes, nail these things.
Small business--you've got to have capital, you've got to credit, and many of them need mentors or coaches.
And we can create more jobs there in a hurry than any other place.
Governor Clinton, one minute.
This country desperately needs a jobs program, and my first priority would be to pass a jobs program, to introduce it on the first day I was inaugurated.
I would meet with the leaders of the Congress, with all the newly elected members of the Congress and as many others with whom I could meet between the time of the election and the inauguration, and we would present a jobs program.
Then we would present a plan to control health care costs and phase in health care coverage for all Americans.
Until we control health care costs, we're not going to control the deficit.
It is the number one culprit.
But first we must have an aggressive jobs program.
I live in a state where manufacturing job growth has far outpaced the nation in the last few years, where we have created more private sector jobs since Mr. Bush has been president than have been created in the entire rest of the country, where Mr. Bush's labor secretary said job growth has been enormous.
We've done it in Arkansas.
Give me a chance to create these kind of jobs in America.
We can do it.
I know we can.
(APPLAUSE)
President Bush, one minute.
We've got the plan announced for what we can do for small business.
I've already put forward things that'll get this country working fast, some of which have been echoed here tonight--investment tax allowance, capital gains reduction, more on research and development, tax credit for first-time home buyers.
What I'm going to do is say to Jim Baker when this campaign is over, all right, let's sit down now, you do in domestic affairs what you've done in foreign affairs, be kind of the economic coordinator of all the domestic side of the House, and that includes all the economic side, all the training side, and bring this program together.
We're going to have a new Congress, and we're going to say to them, you've listened to the voters the way we have.
Nobody wants gridlock anymore, and so let's get the program through.
And I believe it'll work because, as Ross said, we got the plans.
The plans are all over Washington.
And I've put ours together in something called the Agenda for American Renewal, and it makes sense, it's sensible, it creates jobs, it gets to the base of the kind of jobs we need.
And so I'll just be asking for support to get that put into effect.
All right.
The next question goes to Governor Clinton for 2 minutes.
It will be asked by Sandy.
Governor Clinton, when a president running for the first time gets into the office and wants to do something about the economy, he finds in Washington there's a person who has much more power over the economy than he does: the chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, accountable to no one.
That being the case, would you go along with proposals made by Treasury Secretary James Brady and Congressman Lee Hamilton to make the Federal Reserve Board chairman somehow more accountable to elected officials?
Well, let me say that I think that we might ought to review the terms, the way it works.
But frankly, I don't think that's the problem today.
We have low interest rates today.
At least we have low interest rates that the Fed can control.
Our long-term interest rates are still pretty high because of our deficit and because of our economic performance.
And there was a terrible reaction internationally to Mr. Bush saying he was going to give us 4 more years of trickle-down economics--another across-the- board tax cut and most of it going to the wealthy, with no real guarantee of investment.
But I think the important thing--the important thing-- is to use the powers the president does have on the assumption that, given the condition of this economy, we're going to keep interest rates down if we have the discipline to increase investment and reduce the debt at the same time.
That is my commitment.
I think the American people are ready for action.
I think Congress is hungry for someone who will work with them instead of manipulate them.
Someone who will not veto a bill that has an investment tax credit, middle class tax relief, research and development tax credits as Mr. Bush has done.
Give me a chance to do that.
I don't have to worry in the near term about the Federal Reserve.
Their policies so far, it seems to me, are pretty sound.
President Bush you have one minute.
I don't think the Fed ought to be put under the Executive Branch.
There is a separation there.
I think that's fine.
Alan Greenspan is respected.
I've had some arguments with him about the speed in which we might have lowered interest rates, but Governor Clinton, he talks about the reaction to the markets.
There was a momentary fear that he might win and that the markets went phwee, down like that.
So I don't think we can judge on, the stock market has been strong.
It's been very strong since I've been president.
And they recognize we got great difficulties, but they're also much more optimistic than the pessimists we have up here tonight.
In terms of vetoing tax bills, you're darn right.
I am going to protect the American taxpayer against the spend and tax Congress.
And I'm going to keep on vetoing them, because I don't think we're taxed too little.
I think the government's spending too much.
So Governor Clinton can label it tax for the rich or anything he wants.
I'm going to protect the working man by continuing to veto, and to threaten to veto until we get this new Congress, and then we're going to move forward on our plan.
Iâ€™ve got to protect them.
Mr. Perot, one minute.
Keep the Federal Reserve independent, but let's live in a world of reality.
We live in a global economy, not a national economy.
These interest rates we have now don't make any sense.
We have a four trillion dollar debt, and only in America would you finance seventy percent of it five years or less.
So seventy percent of our debt is five years or less.
It's very interest sensitive.
We have a four percent gap between what we pay for treasuries, and what Germany pays for one to five year treasuries.
That gap is going to close, because the Arabs, the Japanese and folks in this country are going to start buying German treasuries because they can get more money.
Every time our interest rates go up one percent, that adds 28 billion dollars to the deficit or to the debt.
Whichever place you put it.
We are sitting on a ticking time bomb folks, because we have totally mismanaged our country, and we had better get it back under control.
Just think in your own business, if you had all of your long term problems financed short term.
You'd go broke in a hurry.
We're going to move to foreign affairs.
The first question goes to Mr. Perot for a two minute answer, and Sandy will ask it.
Mr Perot, in the postwar coldwar environment, what should be the overriding U.S. national interest?
And what can the United States do, and what can it afford to do, to defend the national interest?
