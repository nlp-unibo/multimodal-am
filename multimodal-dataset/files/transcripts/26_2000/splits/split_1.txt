credits for better and more expensive child care, tax credits for middle class families that don't have health insurance from their employers.
The tax deduction I talked about earlier.
Very exciting deduction for up to $10,000 a year in the cost of a college tuition.
A $3,000 tax credit for the cost -- well, actually for a family member who stays home with a parent or grandparent who is ill. And a very exciting tax credit program that I hope I'll have a chance to talk about later, Bernie, that encourages savings by people early in life and any time in life by having the federal government match savings for the 75 million Americans who make $100,000 or less up to $2,000 a year.
Very briefly, if a young couple making $50,000 a year saves $1,000, the government will put another $1,000 in that account.
By the time they retire, they'll not only have guaranteed Social Security, but more than $200,000 in that retirement fund.
Now, that's --
Your time is up, Senator.
You have to be a CPA to understand what he just said.
The fact of the matter is the plan is so complex that the ordinary American is never going to ever figure out what they even qualify for.
It's a classic example of wanting to have a program, in this case a tax program, that will, in fact, direct people to live their lives in certain ways rather than empowering them to make decisions for themselves.
It is a big difference between us.
They like tax credits, we like tax reform and tax cuts.
Mr. Secretary, this question is for you.
Would you support the effort of House Republicans who want legislation to restrict distribution of the abortion drug RU-486?
The abortion issue is a very tough one, without question, and a very important one.
Governor Bush and I have emphasized while, while we are clearly both pro-life, thatâ€™s what we believe.
We want to reduce the incidence of abortion on our society.
Many on the pro-choice side have said the same thing.
Even Bill Clinton has advocated reducing abortion to make it as rare as possible.
With respect to the question of RU-486, we believe that -- of course, that it's recently been approved by the FDA.
That really was a question of whether or not it was safe to be used by women.
They didn't address the sort of the question of whether or not there should or should not be abortion in the society so much as evaluate that particular drug.
What we would like to be able to do is to look for ways to reach across the divide between the two points of view and find things that we can do together to reduce the incidence of abortion.
Such things as promoting adoption as an alternative.
Encouraging parental notification.
And we also think banning the horrific practice of partial birth abortions is an area where there could be agreement.
Congress has twice passed by overwhelming margins, a significant number of votes from both parties, the ban on partial birth abortions.
Twice it's been vetoed by Bill Clinton and Al Gore.
We would hope eventually they would recognize that's not a good position for them to be in.
With respect to the RU-486 proposal, at this stage I haven't looked in particular at that particular piece of legislation.
Governor Bush made it clear the other night he did not anticipate that he would be able to go in and direct the FDA to reverse course on that particular issue, primarily because the decision they made was on the drug, not the question of whether or not it would support abortion.
It's a very important question and one on which these two tickets have dramatically different points of view.
My answer is no, I would not support legislation that is being introduced in Congress to override the Food and Drug Administration decision on RU-486.
The administration, FDA worked 12 years on this serious problem.
They made a judgment based on what was good for women's health.
A doctor has to pescribe and care for a woman using it.
I think it's a decision we ought to let stand because it was made by experts.
But let me say more generally that the significant difference here on this issue is that Al Gore and I respect and will protect a woman's right to choose.
Our opponents will not.
We know that this is a difficult personal, moral, medical issue, but that is exactly why it ought to be left under our law to a woman, her doctor and her God.
Now, one area in which we agree, Al Gore and I, we believe that the government ought to do everything it can to reduce the number of unwanted pregnancies.
And, therefore, the number of abortions.
Incidentally, here there is good news to report.
The number of abortions is actually down in America over the last eight years.
In fact, over the last eight years the number of teenage pregnancies has dropped 20%.
And the reason it has is that there are good programs out there that Al Gore and I will continue to support, such as family planning and programs that encourage abstinence.
But when the health of a woman is involved, I think the government has to be respectful.
I supported, in fact, a bill in the Senate that would have prohibited late-term abortions except in cases where the health or life of the mother was involved.
I did not support the so-called partial birth abortion bill because it would have prohibited that form of abortion at any stage of the pregnancy regardless of the effect on the health and life of the woman.
That's unacceptable.
This question is for you, Senator.
If Yugoslaviaâ€™s Slobodan Milosevic prevails, notwithstanding the election results, would you support his overthrow?
Well, there's good news from Belgrade today, Bernie, as you know.
It's unconfirmed.
The encouraging news is that the state news agency is reporting that Mr. Kostunica is the president-elect.
There are some press reports that are unconfirmed that say that Milosevic has actually left Belgrade.
That is a very happy ending to a terrible story.
It's the end of a reign of terror.
If that is not confirmed and does not happen, then I think the United States, with its European allies, ought to do everything we can to encourage the people of Serbia to do exactly what they've been doing over the last few days to rise up and end this reign of terror by Milosevic, and bring themselves back into the family of nations where they will be welcomed by the United States and others.
You know, I'm very proud on this night as it appears that Milosevic is about to or has fallen, of the leadership role the United States played in the effort to stop his aggression and genocide in Bosnia and Kosovo.
I know our opponents have said they thought it was overreaching.
It wasn't.
It was a matter of principle in America's national interest and values.
The fact is that we stopped the aggression, we stopped the genocide, and therefore strengthened our relationship with our European allies in NATO.
And, in fact, made the United States more respected and trusted by our allies and more feared by our enemies.
I think that Vice President Gore played a critical role, passionate purposive role in leading the administration, along with Republican supporters like Bob Dole and John McCain, to do the right thing in the Balkans.
And hopefully tonight we're seeing the final results of that bold and brave effort.
Secretary Cheney.
I noted, Bernie, like Joe, I'm pleased to see what happened in Yugoslavia today.
I hope it marks the end of Milosevic.
I think probably more than anything else it's a victory for the Serbian people.
They've taken to the streets to support their democracy, to support their vote.
In some respects this is a continuation of a process that began ten years ago all across eastern Europe and has only now arrived in Serbia.
We saw it in Germany, we saw it in Rumania, we saw it in Czechoslovakia, as the people of eastern Europe rose up and made their claim for freedom.
And I think we all admire that.
I think with respect to how this process has been managed most recently, we want to do everything we can to support Mr. Milosevic's departure.
Certainly, though, that would not involve committing U.S. troops.
I do think it's noteworthy that there appears to be an effort underway to get the Russians involved.
I noted the other night, for example, Tuesday night at the debate in Boston, Governor Bush suggested exactly that we ought to try to get the Russians involved to exercise some leverage over the Serbians.
It's now clear from the press that, in fact, that's exactly what they were doing.
It's -- Governor Bush was correct in his assessment and his recommendation.
He has supported the administration on Kosovo.
He lobbied actively against passage of the Byrd-Warner provision which would have set a specific deadline, one he felt was too soon, for forcing the U.S. troops out.
He's been supportive of the policy that we've seen with respect to Yugoslavia.
And I think he deserves a lot of credit for that.
I would go beyond that.
I think this is an opportunity for the United States to test President Putin of Russia.
That in fact now is the time we ought to find out whether he's committed to democracy.
Whether or not he's willing to support the forces of freedom and democracy diplomatically there in the area of eastern Europe.
And it's a test for him whether he represents the old guard in the Soviet Union.
One of the most important challenges we face as a nation is how we manage that process of integrating those 150 million eastern Europeans into the security and economic framework of Europe.
Your question, Mr. Secretary.
You and Governor Bush charge the Clinton-Gore administration have presided over the deterioration and overextension of America's armed forces.
Should U.S. military personnel be deployed as warriors or peacekeepers?
My preference is to deploy them as warriors.
There may be occasion when it's appropriate to use them in a peacekeeping role, but I think the role ought to be limited, there ought to be a time limit on it.
The reason we have a military is to be able to fight and win wars.
And to maintain with sufficient strength so that would-be adversaries are deterred from ever launching a war in the first place.
I think that the administration has, in fact, in this area failed in a major responsibility.
We've seen a reduction in our forces far beyond anything that was justified by the end of the Cold War.
At the same time we've seen a rapid expansion of our commitments around the world as troops have been sent hither and yon.
There was testimony before the Joint Chiefs of Staff before the Armed Services Committee that pointed out a lot of these problems.
For example General Mike Ryan of the Air Force with 40% fewer aircraft, he's now undertaking three times as many deployments on a regular basis as he had to previously.
We're overcommitted and underresourced.
This has had some other unfortunate effects.
I saw a letter the other day from a young captain stationed in Fort Bragg, a graduate of West Point in '95 getting ready to get out of the service because he's only allowed to train with his troops when fuel is available for the vehicles and only allowed to fire their weapons twice a year.
He's concerned that if he had to send them into combat it would mean lives lost.
That is a legitimate concern, this is a very important area.
The fact that the U.S. military is worse off today than it was eight years ago.
Major responsibility for us in the future, a high priority for myself and Governor Bush to rebuild the U.S. military and to give them the resources they need to do the job we ask them to do for us and give them good leadership.
Senator, you're shaking your head in disagreement.
I am.
I want to assure the American people that the American military is the best-trained, best-equipped, most powerful force in the world.
And that Al Gore and I will do whatever it takes to keep them that way.
It's not right, and it's not good for our military, to run them down essentially in the midst of a partisan political debate.
The fact is that you've got to judge the military by what the military leaders say.
Secretary Bill Cohen, a good republican, and Gen. Shelton the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, will both tell you the American military is ready to meet any threat we may face in the world today.
The fact is, judging by its results from Desert Storm to the Balkans, Bosnia and Kosovo, to the operations that are still being conducted to keep Saddam Hussein in a box in Iraq, the American military has performed brilliantly.
This administration has turned around the drop in spending that began in the mid-'80's and right through the Bush-Cheney administration and the early years of the Clinton administration, but now thatâ€™s stopped.
We passed the largest pay increase in a generation for our military.
And the interesting fact here, in spite of the rhetoric that my opponent has just spoken, the reality is if you look at our projected budgets for the next ten years, Al Gore and I actually commit twice as much, $100 billion in additional funding for our military than Governor Bush does.
And their budget allows nothing additional for acquisition of new weapons systems.
That's something the same Gen. Mike Ryan of the airforce and all the other chiefs of the services will not be happy about because they need the new equipment, the new systems that Al Gore and I are committed to giving them.
Bernie, this is a special interest of mine.
I would like a chance to elaborate further, if I might.
The facts are dramatically different.
I'm not attacking the military, Joe.
I have enormous regard for the men and women of the U.S. military.
I had the privilege of working with them for the four years I was the Secretary of Defense.
No one has a higher regard than I do for them.
It's irresponsible to suggest we shouldn't have this debate, that we should ignore what is a major, major concern.
If you have friends and relatives serving in the U.S. military, you know there's a problem.
If you look at the data that's available, 40% of our Army helicopters are not combat ready.
The combat readiness level in the Air Force dropped from 85% to 65%.
Significant problems of retention.
The important thing for us to remember is that we're a democracy and we're defended by volunteers.
Everybody out there tonight wearing the uniform, standing on guard to protect the United States is there because they volunteered to put on a uniform.
When we don't give them the spare parts they need, when we don't give our pilots the flying hours they need to maintain their proficiency, when we don't give them the kind of leadership that spells out what their mission is and let's them know why they're putting their lives at risk, then we undermine that morale.
That's an extraordinarily valuable trust.
There is no more important responsibility for a President of the United States than his role as Commander in Chief, and the obligation he undertakes on behalf o fall of us when he decides when to send our young men and women to war.
When we send them without the right kind of training, when we send them poorly equipped or with equipment that's old and broken down, we put their lives at risk.
We will suffer more casualties in the next conflict if we don't look to those basic fundamental problems now.
With all due respect this administration has a bad track record in this regard, and it's available for anybody who wants to look at the record and wants to talk to our men and women in uniform, and wants to spend time with the members of the Joint Chiefs, wants to look at readiness levels and other -- other indicators.
Final point, the issue of procurement is very important because we're running now off the buildup of the investment we made during the Reagan years.
As that equipment gets old, it has to be replaced.
We've taken money out of the procurement budget to support other ventures.
We have not been investing in the future of the U.S. military.
It's important to respond to this.
Yes, of course it's an important debate to have as part of this campaign, but I don't want either the military to feel uneasy or the American people to feel insecure.
What I'm saying now I'm basing on serving on the Senate Armed Services Committee talking to exactly the people Dick Cheney has mentioned, the Secretary of Defense, the Chiefs of Staff.
I've visited our fighting forces around the world.
I'm telling you that we are ready to meet any contingency that might arise.
The good news here and the interesting news is that we have met our recruitment targets in each of the services this year.
In fact, in the areas where our opponents have said we are overextended, such as the Balkans, the soldiers there have a higher rate of re-enlistment than anywhere else in the service because they feel a sense of purpose, a sense of mission.
In fact, this administration has begun to transform the American military to take it away from being a Cold War force to prepare it to meet the threats of the new generation of tomorrow, of weapons of mass destruction, of ballistic missiles, terrorism, cyber warfare.
The fact is that Governor Bush recommended in his major policy statement on the military earlier this year that we skip the next generation of military equipment; helicopters, submarines, tactical air fighters, all the rest.
That would really cripple our readiness.
Exactly the readiness that Dick Cheney is talking about.
Al Gore and I are committed to continuing this acquisition program, transforming the military.
There's still fewer people in uniform today, but person-to-person, person-by-person, unit-by-unit, this is the most powerful and effective military, not only in the world today, but in the history of the world.
And again, Al Gore and I will do whatever is necessary to keep it that way.
Senator Lieberman, this question to you.
Once again in the Middle East, peace talks on the one hand,
