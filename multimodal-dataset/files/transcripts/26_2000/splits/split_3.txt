but a superb extra retirement account as well.
Social Security plus with us.
With all due respect, Social Security minus from the Bush-Cheney ticket.
You won't be surprised if I disagree with Joeâ€™s description.
The Social Security system is in trouble.
It's been a fantastic program and has been there for 65 years that has provided benefits for senior citizens over that period of time.
For my parents.
It means a great deal to millions of Americans.
And Governor Bush and I want to make absolutely certain that the first thing we do is guarantee the continuation of those payments, those benefits and keep those promises that were made.
But if you look down the road, you say you're 30 years old today, and I have two daughters about that age.
They seriously question whether or not there will be any system left for them.
That's because the demographics that work out there, it's almost an iron law.
They know how many people there are, when they reach retirement, we know when the baby boom generation is coming along, how long they will live after that, it will drive the system into bankruptcy unless we reform and deal with it.
The reform we would like to offer is to allow our young people to begin to take a portion of the payroll tax, 2% of it, and invest it in a personal retirement account.
That does several things.
First of all, it gives them a stake in the Social Security system.
That becomes their property.
They own it.
They can pass it on to their kids if they want.
They don't have that kind of equity in Social Security today.
Secondly, we can generate a higher return off that investment than you get in the existing system.
Today you get about a 2% return of what you pay into Social Security.
We think we can generate at least 6%.
At least three times what we're able to get now.
And long-term by generating a bigger return, we'll put additional funds into the system that will help us survive that crunch that is otherwise going to hit in the future.
Bottom line is there's a choice here.
With respect to Al Gore and Joe's plan, they don't reform Social Security.
They add another huge obligation on top of it that future generations will have to pay.
They donâ€™t touch the basic system itself.
They don't reform it and don't save it.
We have a plan to do that and a plan to give our young people a choice and more control over their own lives.
Mr. Secretary, this question is for you.
Washington is a caldron of political bickering and partisanship.
The American people, gentleman, have had enough.
How would you elevate political discourse and purpose?
Well, I think there are a number of ways to do it.
First of all, I agree with your assessment.
I've been out of Washington for the last eight years and spent the last five years running a company global concern.
And been out in the private sector building a business, hiring people, creating jobs.
I have a different perspective on Washington than I had when I was there in the past.
I'm proud of my service for 25 years, but also proud I had the opportunity to go out and get a different experience.
And you're absolutely right.
People are fed up.
They've had enough with the bickering and the partisanship that seems to characterize the debate that goes on in the nation's capital.
I've seen it done differently though.
Iâ€™ve seen it in Texas.
I've watched George Bush.
And one of the reasons I was eager to sign on when he asked me to become his running mate is because I've been so tremendously impressed with what he's done as the Governor of Texas.
He came in when he had a legislature completely controlled by the other party.
He managed to reach across partisan lines and unite republicans, and democrats and independents and put them to work to achieve good things for the State of Texas.
Partly because he didn't point the finger of blame looking for scapegoats he was quick to share the credit.
He ended up, as a result of that activity of his first term, having the top Democrat in the state, Bob Bulloch, endorse George Bush for reelection.
It's possible to change the tone.
It is possible to get people to work together and to begin to focus on achieving results.
I think it will take new leadership.
I don't think you can do it, with all due respect to Al Gore, with somebody who spent all the last 24 years in that Washington environment and who campaigns on the basis of castigating others, pointing the finger of blame at others in terms of blaming business or various groups for failings.
I think you have to be able to reach out and work together and build coalitions.
I think George W. Bush has done it in Texas and can do it at the national level.
You're absolutely right.
There's too much partisanship in Washington.
It puzzles me.
You think people in public life and politics would want to do what would make them popular, and too often people in both parties act in a way that brings down the institutions of government, and each of us individually, and it's a shame.
I have tried very hard in my career to call them as I see them and work with colleagues on both sides of the aisle to get things done.
I'm proud of my record in that regard, and I certainly think that would be an asset that I could bring to the vice presidency should I be fortunate enough to be elected.
In my senate career Iâ€™ve worked with Bob Dole on Bosnia.
I worked with John McCain on cultural values.
I worked with Connie Mack on foreign policy.
Don Nichols on the International Religious Freedom Act.
If I go on much longer I'll get in trouble with my own party.
That's the way things get done.
I'm proud of those partnerships.
Let me say a word about Al Gore.
In his years in the house and Senate, he formed similar bipartisan partnerships.
If you look back over the last eight years, the most significant accomplishments of this administration in which Al Gore was centrally involved were the result, most of them, of bipartisan agreements.
After all, the Welfare Reform Act, which Al Gore promised to lead the effort on to get people off of welfare to set time limits, to get people to enjoy the dignity of work.
That was a bipartisan act that was adopted.
The Anti-Crime Act that has helped to lower crime more than 20% in our country was also bipartisan.
The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 which was critical to getting our economy to the point and our government to the point of unprecedented surplus we enjoy today also was bipartisan, and Al Gore was involved.
I would say that's exactly the kind of bipartisan leadership that he and I can bring to Washington to get things done.
With all due respect, Joe, there's an awful lot of evidence that there hasn't been any bipartisan leadership out of this administration or Al Gore.
The fact is the Medicare problems have not been addressed.
We have had eight years of problems with prescription drugs not being addressed.
Social Security problemâ€™s not been addressed.
The educational problem has not been addressed.
Weâ€™ve had eight years of talk but no action.
They've been in a position of responsibility in the White House.
The powerful interests, if you will, in Washington, D.C. and been unable to work with others.
Medicare is a good example.
The Breaux Commission, a good effort at a bipartisan solution for Medicare whether you bought or didn't buy the answer that was generated, the fact is the administration set it up and pulled the plug on it because they would rather have an issue, not a solution.
They haven't lead from a bipartisan standpoint and I think Al Gore's record isn't very good.
Dick Cheney must be one of the few people who think nothing has been accomplished in the last eight years.
Promises were made and promises were kept.
Has Al Gore -- did Al Gore make promises in 1992?
Absolutely.
Did he deliver?
Big time.
If I may put it that way.
That's the record.
Look at the 20 -- look at the 22 million new jobs.
Look at the 4 million new businesses.
Look at the lower interest rates, low rate of inflation, high rate of growth.
I think if you asked most people in America today that famous question that Ronald Reagan asked, "Are you better off today than you were eight years ago?"
Most people would say yes.
I'm pleased to see, Dick, from the newspapers that you're better off than you were eight years ago, too.
I can tell you, Joe, the government had absolutely nothing to do with it.
(LAUGHTER) (APPLAUSE)
This question is to you.
I can see my wife and I think she's thinking, "I wish he would go out into the private sector."
Iâ€™m going to try to help you do that, Joe.
I think you've done so well there, I want to keep you there.
(LAUGHTER)
Dick Cheney, Joe Lieberman, you are black for this question.
Imagine yourself an African-American.
You become the target of racial profiling either while walking or driving.
African-American Joseph Lieberman, what would you do about it?
I would be outraged.
It is such an assault on the basic promise that America makes that the law will treat individuals as individuals regardless of their status.
That is to say their race, their nationality, their gender, sexual orientation, etcetera, etcetera.
And the sad fact is that racial profiling occurs in this country.
I have a few African-American friends who have gone through this horror and, you know, it makes me want to kind of hit the wall because it's such an assault on their humanity and their citizenship.
We can't tolerate it anymore.
That's why Iâ€™ve supported legislation in the first instance in Congress.
Because it's the most we could get done to do hard studies to make the case of the extent to which racial profiling is occurring in our country.
But it's also why I'm so proud that Al Gore said two things.
First we would issue, if we're fortunate enough to be elected, an executive order prohibiting racial profiling.
And secondly the first Civil Rights Act legislation we would send to Congress would be a national ban on racial profiling.
It is just wrong.
It is unAmerican, and to think that in the 21st Century this kind of nonsense is still going on.
We have to stop it.
The only way to stop it is through the law.
The law, after all, is meant to express our values and our aspirations for our society.
And our values are violently contradicted by the kind of racial profiling that I know exists.
I had a friend a while ago who works in the government, works at the White House, African-American, stopped, surrounded by police for no other cause that anyone can determine than the color of his skin.
That can't be in America anymore.
Mr. Secretary.
Bernie, I would like to answer your question to the best of my ability, but I don't think I can understand fully what it would be like.
I try hard to put myself in that position and imagine what it would be like, but I've always been part of the majority, never part of a minority group.
It has to be a horrible experience.
The sense of anger and frustration and rage that go with knowing that the only reason you were stopped, the only reason you were arrested, was because of the color of your skin would make me extraordinarily angry, and I'm not sure how I would respond.
I think that we have to recognize that while we've made enormous progress in the U.S. in racial relations and come a great long way, we still have a very long way to go.
We still have not only the problems we're talking about here tonight in terms of the problems you mentioned in profiling, but beyond that, we still have an achievement gap in education, income differentials, differences in life span.
We still have, I think, a society that -- where we haven't done enough yet to live up to that standard that we'd all like to live up to.
I think in terms of equality of opportunity, that we judge people as individuals.
As Martin Luther King said, we ought to judge people on the content of their character instead of the color of their skin.
I would hope we can continue to make progress int that regard in the years ahead.
Senator, sexual orientation.
Should a male who loves a male and a female who loves a female have all -- all the constitutional rights enjoyed by every American citizen?
Very current and difficult question.
I've been thinking about it.
I want to explain what my thoughts have been.
Maybe I should begin this answer by going back to the beginning of the country and the Declaration of Independence which says there at the outset that all of us are created equal and that we're endowed not by any bunch of politicians or philosophers, but by our Creator, with those inalienable rights of life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.
At the beginning of our history, that promise that ideal was not realized or experienced by all Americans, but over time since then we have extended the orbit of that promise.
In our time at the frontier of that effort is extending those kinds of rights to gay and lesbian Americans who are citizens of this country and children of the same awesome God just as much as any of the rest of us are.
That's why I have been an original co-sponsor of the Employment Non-Discrimination Act which aims to prevent gay and lesbian Americans who are otherwise qualified from being discriminated against in the workplace.
And I've sponsored other pieces of legislation and taken other actions that carry out that ideal.
The question you pose is a difficult one for this reason.
It confronts or challenges the traditional notion of marriage as being limited to a heterosexual couple, which I support.
I must say I'm thinking about this, because I have friends who are in gay and lesbian partnerships who said to me, isn't it fair.
We don't have legal rights to inheritance, visitation when one partner is ill, to health care benefits.
That's why I'm thinking about it.
My mind is open to taking some action that will address those elements of unfairness while respecting the traditional religious and civil institution of marriage.
Mr. Secretary.
This is a tough one, Bernie.
The fact of the matter is we live in a free society, and freedom means freedom for everybody.
We donâ€™t get to choose, and we shouldn't be able to choose and say you get to live free and you don't.
That means people should be free to enter into any kind of relationship they want to enter into.
It's no one's business in terms of regulating behavior in that regard.
The next step then, of course, is the question you ask of whether or not there ought to be some kind of official sanction of the relationships or if these relationships should be treated the same as a traditional marriage.
That's a tougher problem.
That's not a slam dunk.
The fact of the matter is that it is regulated by the states.
I think different states are likely to come to different conclusions, and that's appropriate.
I don't think there should necessarily be a federal policy in this area.
I try to be open minded about it as much as I can and tolerant of those relationships.
And like Joe, I'm also wrestling with the extent to which there ought to be legal sanction of those relationships.
I think we ought to do everything we can to tolerate and accommodate whatever kind of relationships people want to enter into.
It occurs to me your moderator has committed a boo-boo.
I asked the racial profiling question of you and you responded and then I asked the sexual orientation question of you.
I should not have done that in terms of rotation.
Gentlemen, I apologize.
We forgive you.
Thank you.
You're human, like we are.
Mr. Secretary.
Vice President of the United States of America, what would you bring to the job that you're opponent wouldn't?
We clearly come from different political perspectives.
Joe is a Democrat from New England, I'm a Republican from the west, from Wyoming.
And I think that weighs into it to some extent.
Clearly we're both in the positions we're in because of our personal relationships with our principals.
I think the areas that I would bring are the things that Governor Bush emphasized when he picked me.
That I have been White House Chief of Staff and ran the White House under President Ford.
Spent ten years in the House, eight of that in the leadership.
Served as Secretary of Defense, and then had significant experience in the private sector.
I think that where there are differences between Joe and myself in terms of background and experience, I clearly have spent a lot of time in executive positions running large organizations both in private business as well as in government.
And that is a set of qualifications that Governor Bush found attractive when he selected me.
I'll leave it at that.
Senator?
I have great respect for Dick Cheney.
I don't agree with a lot of things he said in this campaign.
But I have a lot of respect for him.
He was a very distinguished Secretary of Defense, and I don't have anything negative to say about him.
I want to say with the humility that is required to respond to this statement that I think what I would bring to the office of the vice presidency is a lifetimeâ€™s experience.
Growing up in a working class family, having the opportunity to go to a great public school system, then to go on to college and then to be drawn really by President Kennedy, as well as the values of service my family gave me, into public life.
Wanting to make a difference.
I have had extraordinary opportunities, thanks again to those folks back home in Connecticut, Â as a state senator, attorney general trying to enforce the law to protect them and the environment and consumers, and to litigate on behalf of humans rights.
And for the last 12 years as a member of the Senate of the United States focusing on national security questions, environmental protection, economic growth and values.
But perhaps what I most bring is
