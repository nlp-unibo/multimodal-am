deadly confrontations on the other, and the flashpoint, Jerusalem, and then there's Syria.
Is United States policy what it should be?
Yes, it is.
It has truly pained me in the last week to watch the unrest and the death occurring in the Middle East between the Israelis and the Palestinians.
So much work has been done by the people there with the support of this administration.
So much progress has been made in the original Oslo agreements between the Israelis, the Palestinians, adopted in 1993, and the peace between Israel and Jordan thereafter.
I mean America has a national strategic interest and principled interest in peace in the Middle East, and Al Gore has played a critical role in advancing that process over the last eight years.
What pains me is I watched the unrest in recent days between the Israelis and the Palestinians.
That these two peoples have come in some senses, generations forward, centuries forward, in the last seven years.
They are so close to a final peace agreement, I hope and pray that the death and unrest in the last week will not create the kinds of scars that make it hard for them to go back to the peace table with American assistance and achieve what I'm convinced the great majority of the Israeli and Palestinian people want, and indeed these people throughout the Middle East, which is peace.
Secretary Albright has been in Paris meeting with prime minister Barak and chairman Arafat.
I hope and pray her mission is successful, that there is a cease fire, and the parties return to the peace table.
We've been on a very constructive course in the Middle East, played an unusual, unique role.
And I'm convinced that Al Gore and I will continue to do that.
I hope I might, through my friendships in Israel and throughout the Arab world, play a unique role in bringing peace to this -- this sacred region of the world.
Bernie, it has been a very, very difficult area to work in for a long time.
Numerous administrations going back certainly to World War II have had to wrestle with the problem of what should happen to the Middle East.
We made significant breakthroughs, I think, at the end of the Bush administration because of the Gulf War.
In effect, we had joined together with Arab allies and done enormous damage to the Iraqi armed forces.
Iraq was the biggest military threat to Israel.
By virtue of the end of the Cold War, the Soviets were no longer a factor.
They used to fish in troubled waters whenever they had the opportunity in the Middle East.
With the end of the Soviet Union, the implosion of the empire, that created a vacuum if you will, and made it easier for us to operate there.
We were able to, I think, reassure both Arabs and Israelis would play a major role there.
We have the ability and the will to deploy forces if we had to, to engage in military operations to help our friends and oppose our foes.
We were able to convene them in a conference.
The first time Arab and Israelis sat down face-to-face and began this process of trying to move the peace process forward.
I think also a lot of credit goes to some great men like Yitzak Rabin.
His tragic passing was of great consequence, a great tragedy for everybody who cares about peace in the Middle East.
He was a man who had the military stature to be able to confidently persuade the Israelis to take risks for peace.
I think Barak has tried to same thing.
I hope that we can get this resolved as soon as possible.
My guess is the next administration is going to be the one that is going to have to come to grips with the current state of affairs there.
I think it's very important that we have an administration where we have a president with firm leadership who has the kind of track record of dealing straight with people, of keeping his word so friends and allies both respect us and our adversaries fear us.
This question is for you, Mr. Secretary.
If Iraq's president Saddam Hussein were found to be developing weapons of mass destruction, Governor Bush has said he would, quote, "Take him out."
Would you agree with such a deadly policy?
We might have no other choice.
We'll have to see if that happens.
The thing about Iraq, of course, was at the end of the war we had pretty well decimated their military.
We had put them back in the box, so to speak.
We had a strong international coalition raid against them, effective economic sanctions, and a very robust inspection regime was in place under the U.N. auspices and it was able to do a good job of stripping out the capacity to build weapons of mass destruction, the work he had been doing that had not been destroyed during the war in biological and chemical agents, as well as a nuclear program.
Unfortunately now we find ourselves in a situation where that started to fray on us, where the coalition now no longer is tied tightly together.
Recently the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain, two Gulf States, have reopened diplomatic relations with Baghdad.
The Russians and French are flying commercial airliners back into Baghdad and thumbing their nose at the international sanctions regime, and of course U.N. inspectors have been kicked out and thereâ€™s been absolutely no response. . We're in a situation today where our posture with Iraq is weaker than it was at the end of the war.
It's unfortunate.
I also think it's unfortunate we find ourselves in a position where we don't know for sure what might be transpiring inside Iraq.
I certainly hope he's not regenerating that kind of capability, but if he were, if in fact Saddam Hussein were taking steps to try to rebuild nuclear capability or weapons of mass destruction, you would have to give very serious consideration to military action to -- to stop that activity.
I don't think you can afford to have a man like Saddam Hussein with nuclear weapons in the Middle East.
Senator.
It would, of course, be a very serious situation if we had evidence, credible evidence, that Saddam Hussein was developing weapons of mass destruction.
I must say, I don't think a political campaign is the occasion to declare exactly what we would do in that case.
I think that's a matter of such critical national security importance that it ought to be left to the Commander in Chief, leaders of the military, Secretary of State to make that kind of decision without the heat of a political campaign.
The fact is that we will not enjoy real stability in the Middle East until Saddam Hussein is gone.
The Gulf War was a great victory.
And incidentally, Al Gore and I were two of the ten Democrats in the Senate who crossed party lines to support President Bush and Secretary Cheney in that war.
We're both very proud we did that.
But, the war did not end with a total victory.
Saddam Hussein remained there.
As a result, we have had almost ten years now of instability.
We have continued to operate almost all of this time military action to enforce a no-fly zone.
We have been struggling with Saddam about the inspectors.
We ought to do, and we're doing everything we can to get the inspectors back in there.
But in the end there's not going to be peace until he goes.
And that's why I was proud to co-sponsor the Iraq Liberation Act with Senator Trent Lott why I have kept in touch with the indigenous Iraqi opposition, broad based, to Saddam Hussein.
The Vice President met with them earlier this year.
We are supporting them in their efforts and will continue to support them until the Iraqi people rise up and do what the people of Serbia have done in the last few days, get rid of a despot.
We'll welcome you back into the family of nations where you belong.
Senator Lieberman, this question is for you.
Many experts are forecasting continuing chaotic oil prices in the world market.
Wholesale natural gas prices here in our country are leaping.
Then there are coal and electricity.
Have previous Republican and Democratic Congresses and administrations, including this one, done their job to protect the American people?
Not enough, but this administration and Vice President Gore and I have had both a long-term strategy to develop energy independence and a short-term strategy.
In fact, if the -- this administration had been given the amount of funding that it had requested from the Republican Congress, we would be further along in the implementation of that long-term strategy aimed at developing cleaner sources of energy, giving tax credits to individuals and businesses to conserve and use energy more efficiently.
Aimed at a partnership for a new generation of vehicles with the American automobile industry which is making great progress and can produce a vehicle that can get 80 miles per gallon.
We also have a short-term strategy.
To deal with exactly the kind of ups and downs of energy prices.
I know it was controversial, but Al Gore and I believed it was important in the short-term to reach into the strategic petroleum reserve, take some of the oil we have, put it in the market, show the big oil companies and the OPEC oil-producing countries that weâ€™ve got some resources with which we can fight back.
We aren't going to lay back and let them roll over our economy.
We did it also because gasoline prices were rising and home heating oil inventories were real low.
Both of our tickets agree on LIHEAP keeping the low income housing assistance program, but our opponents offer no assistance to middle-class families hit by rising gas prices and a shortage of home heating oil.
The fact is that since the reserve was opened the price of oil on world markets has dropped $6 a barrel.
That's a good result and I'm proud of it.
Mr. Secretary.
This is an area, again, where I think again Joe and I have fairly significant disagreements.
My assessment is that there is no comprehensive energy policy today.
That as a nation, we are in trouble because the administration has not addressed these issues.
We have the prospects of brownouts in California.
We have a potential home heating oil crisis in the northeast.
We have gasoline price rises in various other places.
For years now the administration has talked about reducing our dependence on foreign sources of oil, but they haven't done it.
In fact, we've gone exactly in the opposite direction.
We have the lowest rate of domestic production of oil now in 46 years.
You have to go back to 1954 to find a time when we produced as little oil as we do today.
Our imports are at an all-time record high.
In June we imported almost 12 million barrels of oil a day.
That means we are more subject to the wide fluctuations and swings in price.
We have other problems.
We don't have refinery capacity.
We haven't built a new refinery in this country for over ten years.
They're operating at 96% or 97% capacity.
Even with more crude available they're probably not going to be able to do very much by way of producing additional home heating oil for this winter.
We have a growing problem with our growing dependence on foreign sources of energy.
That will allways be the case but we ought to be able to shift the trend and begin to move it in the right direction.
We need to do a lot more about generating the capacity for power here at home.
We need to get on with the business and we think we can do it very safely in an environmentally sound manner.
We don't think we ought to buy into this false choice that somehow we cannot develop energy resources without being cautious with the environment.
We can.
We have the technology to do it and we ought to do it.
We do support the low income energy assistance program.
We think it's important that senior citizens don't suffer this winter, but we need to get on to the business of having a plan to develop our domestic energy resources in producing more supplies, and this administration hasn't produced them.
May I respond to that?
Senator, I'm going to continue.
I yield.
Thank you, sir.
Your congressional record, you sponsored a bill that said no to oil and gas exploration in the Wyoming wilderness areas of your home state.
However, you co-sponsored a bill that said yes to drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.
Your explanation?
It shows I have a balanced approach to how we deal with environmental issues.
Not a case of not in my backyard?
No.
I think we have to make choices.
The Wyoming wilderness bill, frankly was one of my proudest achievements as a member of Congress.
I worked on that with my good friend Al Simpson for about four years.
We set aside a part of Wyoming, nearly a million acres of wilderness that ought to be separate and not be developed.
We think that was important.
There are a lot of areas around the country where Governor Bush and I support restraint.
For example we support the moratorium on drilling off the coast of California, but there are places where we think we ought to go forward and develop those resources.
The Arctic National Wildlife Reserve is one of them.
It's on the north slope right next to Prudhoe Bay.
The infrastructure is there to be able to deliver that product to market.
We think we can do it given today's technology in a way that will not damage the environment, will not permanently marr the countryside at all, and so what we're looking for with respect to environmental policy and energy policy is balance.
We do have to make choices, we recognize that.
The way you phrased the question, frankly I welcome because it shows, in fact, we are trying to pursue a balanced approach and the suggestion that somehow all we care about is energy development isn't true.
But we do have to get on with developing those resources or we're going to find ourselves ever more dependent on foreign sources.
We're going to find that the fact that we don't have an energy policy out there is one of the major storm clouds on the horizon for our economy.
I think if you look for something that could develop, some problem that could arise, that might, in fact, jeopardize our continuing prosperity, it's the possibility that we might find ourselves without adequate supplies of energy in the future.
And there would be no quicker way to shut down our economy than that.
Bernie, we agree on the problem but we couldn't disagree more on the response to the problem.
The problem is accurately stated.
No matter how strong we are economically, if we remain dependent on a source of energy that is outside our control, we're not going to be as strong as we should be.
Others around the world can effectively yank our chain, and we cannot allow that to continue to happen.
I'm afraid that our opponent's response to this is one-sided, and it is essentially to develop the resources within the United States almost regardless of where.
I'm against drilling in the Arctic Refuge.
This is one of the most beautiful, pristine places that the good Lord has created on earth.
It happens to be within the United States of America.
It's not worth it to do that for what seems to be the possibility of six months' worth of oil, seven to 12 years from now.
That's not much of a response to the immediate problem that gasoline consumers and home heating oil customers are facing this winter.
There are more resources within the United States that we can develop.
This isn't mentioned much and appreciated much.
In the last eight years drilling for gas on federal lands has gone up 60% and it's been done in an environmentally protected way.
The administration has encouraged the drilling for deep gas and oil going on in the western Gulf today.
The answer here is new technology that will create millions of new jobs.
Let me just say this.
If we can get three miles more per gallon from our cars we'll get a -- we'll save 1 million barrels of oil a day, which is exactly what the refuge at its best in Alaska would produce.
The choice to me is clear.
We have to develop fuel cells, alternative energy, encourage people to conserve and to be efficient.
This question is for you, Senator.
We all know Social Security is the backbone of the retirement system in our nation.
Can either of you pledge tonight categorically that no one will lose benefits under your plans?
Yes, indeed.
I can pledge to the American people categorically that no one will lose benefits under our plan for Social Security as far forward as 2054.
And let me come back and say, Bernie, that Al Gore and I view Social Security as probably the best thing the government did in the second half -- the last century.
It has created a floor under which seniors cannot fall, and so many of them depend on it for their basic living, for their livelihood.
It's critically important to protect it.
That's why Al and I have committed to putting that Social Security surplus in a lockbox, not touching it.
That's what allows us to keep Social Security solvent to 2054.
Our opponents have an idea for privatizing Social Security that will jeopardize Social Security payments to recipients.
And I looked at this idea.
If I may use an oil industry analogy, which is to say that sometimes as you know, Dick, better than I, you have to drill deep to find out whether there's oil in a well.
For a while I was drilling into this idea of privatization of Social Security.
The deeper I got the drier the well became and it seemed to me at the end it was going to dry up Social Security.
It requires taking as much as a trillion dollars out of the Social Security fund.
The independent analysts have said that would put the fund out of money in 2023, or if it's not out of money, benefits will have to be cut by over 50%.
That's just not worth doing.
Al Gore and I are going to guarantee Social Security and add to it the retirement savings plan that I mentioned earlier which will help middle-class families looking forward.
They will have not only Social Security,
