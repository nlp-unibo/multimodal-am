measures to strengthen families, not restrict their access to education.
Mr. Kemp, speaking of the family, where do you come down on it?
Do you believe it should be repealed?
The Family Leave Act?
I wouldn't have voted for it.
It's in place.
Their answer, this administration to every single problem is another regulation and another tax.
Clearly, in America, we need -- I am astounded to think that you can have a strong Family Leave Act or policy by a business if they're not making a profit.
If there aren't a lot of jobs, if there isn't the types of policies that will enhance the formation of the seed corn and the oxygen and the capital that would allow that company not only retain that profit but invest it.
As I said earlier, Dana Crist of Lancaster, Pennsylvania who runs a small little manufacturing or distribution center in Lancaster, said that she as an entrepreneur, would start a whole new factory if the federal government would cut the cost of capital.
She wants the capital gains rate reduced.
And if, to Al Gore and Bill Clinton that is somehow, trickle-down economics.
Tell that to Dana Crist, tell it to Van Woods, tell it to the men and women I met in South Central.
Tell it to anybody who understands how to makes democratic capitalism work.
I want to say it one more time.
The real excitement of a Dole/Kemp Administration would be to get out of this current tax code that redistributes wealth and create a brand new system for the 21st Century that's pro-family, pro-growth and stops the double, triple and quadruple taxation of income from work, savings, investment and entrepreneurial risk taking in America.
The question as I recall, it was about Family and Medical Leave.
Here's how it works.
If you have a child who is critically ill or has been seriously injured and you have to stay with that child in the hospital, some employers, have said you can't take too much time off in spite of these circumstances.
I personally know people who have been fired because they made the choice to be with their child.
Don't tell me this doesn't happen.
It happens all across the United States.
But since Bill Clinton made this the first law he signed, it has been use 12 million times by American families to reconcile the demands of work with the responsibilities to the family.
We now want to extend it to PTA meetings and scheduled doctors appointments.
It shouldn't be repealed.
It ought to be extended.
75 percent of businesses who have been -- had experience with it say they like it.
It works.
Well, it was here before Bill Clinton and it will be here after Bill Clinton.
Senator Tsongas a good friend of Senator Gore, Vice President Gore suggested that he was afraid his party was falling into the trap of loving the employee, but hating the employer.
You cannot love labor and hate employers.
You cannot drive this wedge between workers and management.
And businesses were providing family leave.
They will continue.
They should.
They've got to make a profit and the tax on business, capital, labor and families is too high and it will -- we want to reduce that regulatory burden and that tax burden in a new Dole/Kemp Administration.
Gentlemen, that was the last question, so now we go to the closing statements.
There will be three minutes each and Mr. Kemp, you are first.
Thank you, Jim and thanks to the people of St. Petersburg for a fantastic hospitality and my friend, Al Gore, for a vigorous debate.
I think this is the most exciting time in the history of the world to be alive.
We have lived through what Jean Kirpatrick called the bloodiest century in mankind's history.
We have defeated in this system of ours fascism, Nazism, communism, socialism is defunct or debunked around the world, the evil of apartheid has ended.
There is only one last question remaining for the next century, indeed the next millennium.
Can we, in America, make the world's greatest liberal democracy, this democratic experiment in private property, limited government, the rule of law, respect for families and traditional Judeo-Christian values work, so it can be a blessing to our country and a blessing to the rest of the world?
With all due respect to this administration, they've got a foreign policy in disarray.
They have a lack of credibility around the world.
Weakness, I said earlier, is provocative and clearly, this economy is not performing up to the standards that we would expect from this great nation going into the most exciting global economy the world has ever known.
There's something amiss.
Our culture seems to be weakening all around us.
Families are under tremendous pressure.
People do not -- do not feel safe in their homes.
A mother doesn't feel safe sending her child to school.
Our schools are not educating.
It's not the problem of the teachers.
They are overworked and my daughter will tell you, they are underpaid and we know that, they need to be empowered.
We need to reform education.
We need to reform welfare.
We need to reform litigation and regulation.
And we certainly need to reform this tax code that is a product of this terrible century of war and recession and inflations.
It can be done.
We need somebody who understands the potential of the American people, who are not just doing well for ourselves, we need to do well for the rest of the world, because they're looking at us.
And we need to make it work in every neighborhood and community in America and for every family, so that no one as Bob Dole said in his San Diego acceptance speech is left behind.
Bob Dole, as I said earlier, is a man of courage, a man of principles, a man who crawled out of a fox hole on Riva Ridge in 1945 to save a wounded brethren.
The bible says no greater love hath a man than he gave his life.
Well, Bob Dole did, just about, he'd been through the valley of the shadow and he as Commander-in-Chief can take this country with the courage of Churchill.
The principles of Lincoln and the indefatigable optimism and spirit that this nation expects from its Commander-in-Chief and the next President of the United States, Bob Dole.
Mr. Vice President?
Thank you very much, Mr. Lehrer.
Thanks again to the people of St. Petersburg and thanks again to Jack Kemp.
I have enormous respect for Jack Kemp and for Bob Dole.
They're good men.
I don't agree with their plan.
I've tried to make that clear tonight.
And one reason I've tried to make it clear is that in just 27 days, the United States of America has an important choice to make.
Between two approaches to the future of this country.
We have a plan that will create millions more jobs, bring the deficits down further and balance the budget, while protecting Medicare, protecting Medicaid, protecting and preserving the environment, our air, our water, the Everglades, the Tongas, the Mojave Desert in California, the Utah-Red Rocks area, all of which have been protected by President Bill Clinton.
We also have a plan to expand access to education.
There's a family in the audience tonight, the McNeil family, who lives right here in St. Petersburg.
Both parents are teachers, they're not rich in money, but they have strong values and they value education.
They're oldest son is a freshman at St. Petersburg Junior High -- Junior College.
Their younger son, Roderick, is a sophomore in the same high school that Don McNeil teaches at.
Roderick is concerned that he may not be able to get the tuition he needs to go to college when the time comes.
Our plan gives a $1500 tax credit to make that junior college essentially free.
And a $10,000 tax deduction to make it so that no American family, or almost no family, will have to pay taxes on the money they pay for college tuition.
This plan also gives tax breaks on the sale of a home, up to $500,000 in profit tax free.
It gives the new break for first-time home buyers, and, again, all in the context of a balanced budget.
We have seen progress during the last four years because policies like these have been working.
This risky scheme that I've described tonight has been said by many objective observers to not add up, it would be a serious risk.
Our plan, by contrast, has been working and will work more.
We want to build a bridge to the 21st Century and we want it to be strong enough and broad enough for all families to cross and we want it to lead to a brighter future for America, 'cause our best days are ahead.
