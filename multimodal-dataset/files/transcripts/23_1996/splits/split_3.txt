fund Act.
We have been taking a new approach, protecting the environment, but getting rid of unnecessary regulations.
We're eliminating 16,000 pages of regulations.
We've entered a -- into a new project called project XL.
This is at the EPA.
Where we enter into a bargain with businesses.
When they say we'll exceed the standards, we give the EPA a way to measure the progress and throw away the rulebook all together.
Now this is the kind of common sense approach that can clean up the environment while eliminating unnecessary red tape.
Make no mistake about it, though, there are those who would like to go much further.
Some have even proposed and this bill he cites would do it, that polluters ought to be paid if they agree to stop dumping poisons into the river.
The pay polluters provision is wrong.
We fought against it.
We'll never allow that.
When I went to Congress from Buffalo in 1970, you could almost walk across Lake Erie because of the pollution.
Today, thanks to the secondary and tertiary treatment plants, which many of us voted for on both sides of the aisle, which actually started under Richard Nixon, a Republican president, our water is cleaner in the Great Lakes.
We've got a lot of progress that we've made and we've got to make more, but to turn the country into a regulatory effort by the federal government to suggest that we can't work in harmony, "A" with the environment, and with business is a big mistake.
We should use incentives, not always using uh sticks against business in America and the jobs it creates.
Mr. Vice President, does the government of the -- of the United States as now operated by the Clinton Administration operate on a reign of terror, through a reign of terror?
No, of course not.
We're taking a brand new approach to eliminate unnecessary regulations, unnecessary bureaucracy.
We've got lots of examples of this there was a story in the newspaper the other day about a home testing kit that the FDA had held up.
That happened under a rule in the last administration.
We said change that rule.
It's being changed now.
It's under consideration by the FDA right now and it will be changed.
There are thousands of other examples.
We believe that there is a new approach.
Let me give you an example from OSHA.
We're reinventing the way OSHA does its job.
Some people would like to eliminate OSHA.
We think that the protection of job safety in the workplace is very, very important, but what we've said is look, start, start measuring the results.
We found that the inspectors were being rewarded on the basis of how many fines they issued.
We changed that completely.
They used to go in and give somebody a fine if they didn't have a poster on the wall informing employees of their rights.
To use this as an example of our new approach, now if they go in and see that poster is not there, they go out to the trunk of the car and give them a poster.
It's the same approach that we're taking in all the regulatory agencies.
We're making a lot of progress.
We want the protection with common sense, not nonsense.
Well, we have to have the type of economic prosperity that will allow us to generate the revenues to provide this technology.
10% of all the emissions -- 10% of the all the hydrocarbon emissions oxides going into the air caused by 10% -- 100% of the all the emissions are caused by 10% of the automobiles.
Now there is technology that would allow infrared technology to be used to identify those cars that are providing or the pollution in our atmosphere.
It is not being able to be used because we are going to take every automobile driver in America, all 110 million automobiles, and charge them 17 or 20 or $25.
Look, we ought to go after the ones that pollute, not go after the men and women who want to be able to drive their automobile to work or to school and to make sure that they have the type of opportunity to live like everyone else without having themselves regulated by Washington establishment.
We can use technology.
That's the answer, but to get the technology, you've got to have a growing economy.
This economy is not growing fast enough and it will under Bob Dole and Jack Kemp.
Well, the economy is growing very strongly right now.
We've had 10.5 million new jobs created just in the last four years.
In the last quarter, the growth rate was 4.7%.
The average growth rate is also coming up.
It is higher than in either of the last two Republican administrations.
Bob Dole said in February of this year this is the strongest economy in 30 years.
The conservative business journal, "Barron's," says this is the strongest economy in 30 years.
We've got good solid growth.
Let's don't risk it on some $550-billion risky scheme.
What measurement do you use, Mr. Kemp, in saying the economy is not growing the way it should be?
Well, as I said earlier, Jim, it takes two bread winners to do what one breadwinner could have done just a relatively few short few years ago.
As long as a woman or man wants to go to work it ought to be their choice, but in America today that woman or man must work in a family to, one to pay the tax and the other to help the family.
That's not America.
It doesn't leave enough time for the children.
It doesn't leave enough time for people to enjoy their families.
It doesn't allow people to save.
The family is the most overtaxed institution in the United States of America.
When I was growing up in Los Angeles, a family that median level of income might have sent four or five percent of their income to the federal government.
Today, it's close to 30, or at least 27 or 28%.
That's just unacceptable, and for Al Gore to keep suggesting that we can't afford to reduce the tax rates across-the-board on the American people and on the formation of the capital necessary to create the new jobs for America is just totally at odds with the experience of both Ronald Reagan, John F. Kennedy and other times in this century.
One other thing that's very, very important.
To call it a risky scheme reminds me of the fact that this administration is suggesting that they're going to give you a tax cut if you'll do what they want you to do.
They want to cut the Capital Gain Tax, but only for home owners.
How about the small businessmen and women of America that create 91% of all the new jobs?
My Daddy was a truck driver who bought the truck and started a company.
We need more truck drivers becoming truck owners and they can't do it if they don't have access to the capital and the seed corn for the next generation of truck and jobs for America.
We've had the creation of more new small businesses in the last four years in each of the last three years than in any other year in all of American history.
We've seen the creation of 10.5 million new jobs.
We have the lowest combined rate of inflation and unemployment in 30 years.
"Business Week" magazine said these are the kind of results that you want.
Lower inflation, lower interest rates, more jobs and more growth, all within the context of a balanced budget.
We have reduced the budget deficit four years in a row.
We've cut it down 60 percent.
After it went up by almost 300 percent during the previous two administrations.
Now, this is the kind of growth that we want more of.
We think we can do much better still.
That's why we're pushing these income tax cuts for middle income families in the context of a balanced budget that protects important programs.
Four years too late.
You told us that four years ago.
And we still don't have it.
How can we trust an administration that, all of a sudden, four years into or the last year of its four years tells us that now they're going to follow through on the promise they made four years ago?
This economy is not growing fast enough.
The haves are doing well, but Jim the have-nots are not doing well.
There's people hurting, there're families that can't stay together.
There's jobs that are not being created, and the unemployment rate in our nations' inner cities is somewhere between 16 and 25 percent.
That is morally and socially unacceptable in a modern day economy.
Mr Vice President, Senator Dole raised the same question to President Clinton the other night about keeping promises made.
What is your reaction to that?
What is your response to that charge against you and the President.
President Bill Clinton promised to create 8 million jobs.
He's created 10 and a half million new jobs.
He's promised to cut the budget deficit in half.
He has cut it by 60 percent.
He promised to end welfare as we know it.
He passed and signed the Welfare Reform Law.
He has already moved 1.9 million people off the welfare rolls into good jobs.
We've got a plan to move 1 million more off welfare during the next four years.
He promised to implement the death penalty.
We passed an anti-crime Bill that has 60 new death penalty provisions.
He promised to pass a plan that would put 100,000 new police officers on the streets.
It is law, over the opposition of Senator Dole, and 20,000 of them are already on the streets, 2,000 of them have been funded already for here in Florida.
We're ahead of schedule and we're going to get the additional 80,000 new police officers on the streets in the coming four years, 45,000 of them are now already funded.
That is a record of promises made and promises kept.
He promised middle-income tax cuts.
We've cut taxes for 15 million families and our plan to cut them for all middle income families has been waiting for action in the Congress for two full years.
In the next four years, we will pass it.
Well, to say that this is the best economy in 30 years just staggers the imagination.
We have a growth rate of the last four years of about two and a half percent.
My friend Al Gore says itâ€™s better than the Reagan years.
It isn't.
But irrespective of whether he thinks it is or not means less than fact that this country cannot morally and socially and economically accept an economy running out the clock on the 20th Century.
We're treading water.
We have families that are hurting.
We have people who are unemployed.
We have people with no property.
We have an administration that is demolishing public housing in our inner cities and not providing anything else but more public housing.
Their solution to the inner city is more -- excuse the expression but it's true, "socialism."
It is not for the people.
It is for the government to tell them where to live, where to go to school.
We need school choice.
We need to privatize public housing, we need to sell it to the residents, we need to put enterprise zone into, in, America and need to lower the rates of taxation on labor, capital and the factors of production.
That'll happen under Bob Dole.
We are demolishing the outdated projects that did not work and we're replacing them with new units that do work.
And we have private vouchers so that individuals can choose for themselves where they live and we're selling these units to many of those who want to buy them.
Mr. Kemp had a good idea when he advocated that years ago.
He talked about it, we did it, and we're going to do a lot more of it, if we have the opportunity with the help of the American people.
Mr. Kemp, uh some are saying these days that something's gone terribly wrong with the American soul, that we've become too mean, too selfish, too uncaring and the spitting incident, how it was handled, the baseball players used as a recent example.
What do you think about that?
Civility, responsibility, racial reconciliation, healing the wounds of our country has to be one of the greatest, most singularly important goals for this country here on the edge of the 21st Century.
How in the name of American democracy can we say to eastern Europe that democratic capitalism will work there if we can't make it work in East L.A. or East Harlem or East Palo Alto, California?
How can we tell South Africa and the new Mandela government that democracy and private property and limited government and the rule of law and civility will work there if it's not working in our own backyard here at home or the South Bronx?
How can America go into the next century and leave so many people behind?
"USA Today," just few weeks ago did a study.
They said the affluent are doing very well in America, the haves, the have-nots and the poor are being left behind.
It is a giant, in my opinion, zero sum game.
Kind of like musical chairs when we were young boys and girls growing up.
And it seemed like when the music stopped the big guy elbowed out the little guy from that last chair.
That's not America folks.
We need more chairs, we need a bigger table, we need a greater banquet.
We need to create more wealth.
We need to create more jobs and more access to credit and capital and educational choice and opportunity for any man or woman and child to be what God meant them to be, not what Washington, D.C. wants them to be.
I think Mr. Lehrer, that throughout much of his career, Jack Kemp has been a powerful and needed voice against the kind of coarseness and incivility that you refer to in the question.
I think it's an extremely valuable service to have a voice within the Republican party who says we ought to be one nation.
We ought to cross all of the racial and ethnic and cultural barriers.
I think that is a very important message to deliver.
And we ought to speak out against these violations of civility when they do occur.
You asked about the incident involving Roberto Alomar.
I won't hesitate to tell you what I think.
I think he should have been severely disciplined, suspended perhaps, immediately.
I don't understand why that action was not taken, but the same could be said of so many incidents in all kinds of institutions in our society, but I compliment Mr. Kemp for the leadership he has shown in moving us away from that kind of attitude.
Well, I thank you, Al.
I mean that very, very sincerely, but I'm trying to make a bigger point.
That civility cannot return to our country unless every person feels that they have an equal shot at the American dream.
That if you're born in this country to be a mezzo-soprano or a master carpenter or a school teacher, like my daughter, or a professional football quarterback, nothing should be in your way.
And removing those barriers is what Bob Dole is all about, moving our country forward and leaving no one behind.
Mr. Vice President, do you agree with that thesis that in order to solve the problem of civility, the problems of the American soul, you have to -- it's an economic problem more than it is something else?
I think that economics is one of the single most important parts of this problem.
That's why we're focusing on tax credits, to hire 1 million more people coming off welfare in the inner city.
That's why we're focusing on an economic policy that has already created ten and a half million new jobs and is going to create millions more within the context, again, of a balanced budget that protects important programs.
We have focused especially on the most distressed areas, because we cannot leave anyone behind.
Our empowerment zones and enterprise communities, the tax credits that will encourage the formation of new businesses, the new approach by the small business administration to get more loans out to individuals that have not had equal access to capital in the past.
These are parts of the plan.
Another part of it is the community development financial institutions.
And the -- and the law that says deposits that are made in a community, in the inner cities say, should be kept in the community, not entirely, but some percentage of them should be kept there.
That prevents that money being taken from the community and invested in some go-go investment on the other side of the world.
And when they invest in the community, they find that there's a better payback rate, more small businesses are created and the community improves.
That's happening in America today, not fast enough, but faster than before and we think we can accelerate it with our plan.
There really is no separation between a strong community and a strong economy.
And you can't have a strong economy without strong communities and strong families.
The word "economics" in Greek came from the word family, or law or custom of the family.
A family without a job where both breadwinners are away from home and cannot spend time with their children or can't send the child to the school of their choice rather than just the choice of the federal bureaucracy, cannot possibly be as strong as a family that has the nurture, the love, the dignity and the justice that goes along with one breadwinner, a strong job, and if that man or woman wants to work, it's their choice, not just to pay taxes.
So we need both.
We need strong commun -- we need strong schools, we need schools that nurture the type of discipline and respect from teachers and parents.
And Bob Dole wants to empower the public school districts and the teachers, not the federal bureaucracy at the Department of Education.
Well, Senator Dole has said that he wants to abolish the Department of Education.
He voted against the creation of Head Start.
He vigorously opposed the Family and Medical Leave Act, which was the first law that President Clinton signed as president.
Now, Senator Dole has suggested he would repeal the Family and Medical Leave Act if he had the chance if he was elected president.
We believe in more educational opportunity and
