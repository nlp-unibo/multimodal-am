the United States.
Well, I would say in the latter that the - and that's what I found uh - somewhat unsatisfactory about the figures uh - Mr. Nixon, that you used in your previous speech, when you talked about the Truman Administration.
You - Mr. Truman came to office in nineteen uh - forty-four and at the end of the war, and uh - difficulties that were facing the United States during that period of transition - 1946 when price controls were lifted - so it's rather difficult to use an overall figure taking those seven and a half years and comparing them to the last eight years.
I prefer to take the overall percentage record of the last twenty years of the Democrats and the eight years of the Republicans to show an overall period of growth.
In regard to uh - price stability uh - I'm not aware that that committee did produce recommendations that ever were certainly before the Congress from the point of view of legislation in regard to controlling prices.
In regard to the exchange of students and labor unions, I am chairman of the subcommittee on Africa and I think that one of the most unfortunate phases of our policy towards that country was the very minute number of exchanges that we had.
I think it's true of Latin America also.
We did come forward with a program of students for the Congo of over three hundred which was more than the federal government had for all of Africa the previous year, so that I don't think that uh - we have moved at least in those two areas with sufficient vigor.
The next question to Senator Kennedy from Mr. Warren.
Uh - Senator Kennedy, during your brief speech a few minutes ago you mentioned farm surpluses.
That's correct.
I'd like to ask this: It's a fact, I think, that presidential candidates traditionally make promises to farmers.
Lots of people, I think, don't understand why the government pays farmers for not producing certain crops or paying farmers if they overproduce for that matter.
Now, let me ask, sir, why can't the farmer operate like the business man who operates a factory?
If an auto company overproduces a certain model car Uncle Sam doesn't step in and buy up the surplus.
Why this constant courting of the farmer?
Well, because I think that if the federal government moved out of the program and withdrew its supports uh - then I think you would have complete uh - economic chaos.
The farmer plants in the spring and harvests in the fall.
There are hundreds of thousands of them.
They really don't - they're not able to control their market very well.
They bring their crops in or their livestock in, many of them about the same time.
They have only a few purchasers that buy their milk or their hogs - a few large companies in many cases - and therefore the farmer is not in a position to bargain very effectively in the market place.
I think the experience of the twenties has shown what a free market could do to agriculture.
And if the agricultural economy collapses, then the economy of the rest of the United States sooner or later will collapse.
The farmers are the number one market for the automobile industry of the United States.
The automobile industry is the number one market for steel.
So if the farmers' economy continues to decline as sharply as it has in recent years, then I think you would have a recession in the rest of the country.
So I think the case for the government intervention is a good one.
Secondly, my objection to present farm policy is that there are no effective controls to bring supply and demand into better balance.
The dropping of the support price in order to limit production does not work, and we now have the highest uh - surpluses - nine billion dollars worth.
We've had a uh - higher tax load from the Treasury for the farmer in the last few years with the lowest farm income in many years.
I think that this farm policy has failed.
In my judgment the only policy that will work will be for effective supply and demand to be in balance.
And that can only be done through governmental action.
I therefore suggest that in those basic commodities which are supported, that the federal government, after endorsement by the farmers in that commodity, attempt to bring supply and demand into balance - attempt effective production controls - so that we won't have that five or six percent surplus which breaks the price fifteen or twenty per cent.
I think Mr.Benson's program has failed.
And I must say, after reading the Vice President's speech before the farmers, as he read mine, I don't believe that it's very much different from Mr. Benson's.
I don't think it provides effective governmental controls.
I think the support prices are tied to the average market price of the last three years, which was Mr. Benson's theory.
I therefore do not believe that this is a sharp enough breach with the past to give us any hope of success for the future.
Mr. Nixon, comment?
I of course disagree with Senator Kennedy insofar as his suggestions as to what should be done uh - with re- on the farm program.
He has made the suggestion that what we need is to move in the direction of more government controls, a suggestion that would also mean raising prices uh - that the consumers pay for products and im- and imposing upon the farmers uh - controls on acreage even far more than they have today.
I think this is the wrong direction.
I don't think this has worked in the past; I do not think it will work in the future.
The program that I have advocated is one which departs from the present program that we have in this respect.
It recognizes that the government has a responsibility to get the farmer out of the trouble he presently is in because the government got him into it.
And that's the fundamental reason why we can't let the farmer go by himself at the present time.
The farmer produced these surpluses because the government asked him to through legislation during the war.
Now that we have these surpluses, it's our responsibility to indemnify the farmer during that period that we get rid of the farmer uh - the surpluses.
Until we get the surpluses off the farmer's back, however, we should have a program such as I announced, which will see that farm income holds up.
But I would propose holding that income up not through a type of program that Senator Kennedy has suggested that would raise prices, but one that would indemnify the farmer, pay the farmer in kind uh - from the products which are in surplus.
The next question to Vice President Nixon from Mr. Vanocur.
Uh - Mr. Vice President, since the question of executive leadership is a very important campaign issue, I'd like to follow Mr. Novins' question.
Now, Republican campaign slogans - you'll see them on signs around the country as you did last week - say it's experience that counts - that's over a picture of yourself; sir uh - implying that you've had more governmental executive decision-making uh - experience than uh - your opponent.
Now, in his news conference on August twenty-fourth, President Eisenhower was asked to give one example of a major idea of yours that he adopted.
His reply was, and I'm quoting; "If you give me a week I might think of one.
I don't remember."
Now that was a month ago, sir, and the President hasn't brought it up since, and I'm wondering, sir, if you can clarify which version is correct - the one put out by Republican campaign leaders or the one put out by President Eisenhower?
Well, I would suggest, Mr. Vanocur, that uh - if you know the President, that was probably a facetious remark.
Uh - I would also suggest that insofar as his statement is concerned, that I think it would be improper for the President of the United States to disclose uh - the instances in which members of his official family had made recommendations, as I have made them through the years to him, which he has accepted or rejected.
The President has always maintained and very properly so that he is entitled to get what advice he wants from his cabinet and from his other advisers without disclosing that to anybody - including as a matter of fact the Congress.
Now, I can only say this.
Through the years I have sat in the National Security Council.
I have been in the cabinet.
I have met with the legislative leaders.
I have met with the President when he made the great decisions with regard to Lebanon, Quemoy and Matsu, other matters.
The President has asked for my advice.
I have given it.
Sometimes my advice has been taken.
Sometimes it has not.
I do not say that I have made the decisions.
And I would say that no president should ever allow anybody else to make the major decisions, The president only makes the decisions.
All that his advisers do is to give counsel when he asks for it.
As far as what experience counts and whether that is experience that counts, that isn't for me to say.
Uh - I can only say that my experience is there for the people to consider; Senator Kennedy's is there for the people to consider.
As he pointed out, we came to the Congress in the same year.
His experience has been different from mine.
Mine has been in the executive branch.
His has been in the legislative branch.
I would say that the people now have the opportunity to evaluate his as against mine and I think both he and I are going to abide by whatever the people decide.
Senator Kennedy.
Well, I'll just say that the question is of experience and the question also is uh - what our judgment is of the future, and what our goals are for the United States, and what ability we have to implement those goals.
Abraham Lincoln came to the presidency in 1860 after a rather little known uh - session in the House of Representatives and after being defeated for the Senate in fifty-eight and was a distinguished president.
There's no certain road to the presidency.
There are no guarantees that uh - if you take uh - one road or another that you will be a successful president.
I have been in the Congress for fourteen years.
I have voted in the last uh - eight years uh - and the Vice President was uh - presiding over the Senate and meeting his other responsibilities.
I have met met uh - decisions over eight hundred times on matters which affect not only the domestic security of the United States, but as a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.
The question really is: which candidate and which party can meet the problems that the United States is going to face in the sixties?
The next question to Senator Kennedy from Mr. Novins.
Senator Kennedy, in connection with these problems of the future that you speak of, and the program that you enunciated earlier in your direct talk, you call for expanding some of the welfare programs for schools, for teacher salaries, medical care, and so forth; but you also call for reducing the federal debt.
And I'm wondering how you, if you're president in January, would go about paying the bill for all this.
Does this mean that you?
I didn't indicate.
I did not advocate reducing the federal debt because I don't believe that you're going to be able to reduce the federal debt very much in nineteen sixty-one, two, or three.
I think you have heavy obligations which affect our security, which we're going to have to meet.
And therefore I've never suggested we should uh - be able to retire the debt substantially, or even at all in nineteen sixty-one or two.
Senator, I believe in - in one of your speeches -
No, never.
- you suggested that reducing the interest rate would help toward -
No.
No.
Not reducing the interest -
- a reduction of the Federal debt.
- reducing the interest rate.
In my judgment, the hard money, tight money policy, fiscal policy of this Administration has contributed to the slow-down in our economy, which helped bring the recession of fifty-four; which made the recession of fifty-eight rather intense, and which has slowed, somewhat, our economic activity in 1960.
What I have talked about, however, the kind of programs that I've talked about, in my judgment, are uh - fiscally sound.
Medical care for the aged, I would put under social security.
The Vice President and I disagree on this.
The program - the Javits-Nixon or the Nixon- Javits program - would have cost, if fully used uh - six hundred million dollars by the government per year, and six hundred million dollars by the state.
The program which I advocated, which failed by five votes in the United States Senate, would have put medical care for the aged in Social Security, and would have been paid for through the Social Security System and the Social Security tax.
Secondly, I support federal aid to education and federal aid for teachers' salaries.
I think that's a good investment.
I think we're going to have to do it.
And I think to heap the burden further on the property tax, which is already strained in many of our communities, will provide, will make sh- insure, in my opinion, that many of our children will not be adequately educated, and many of our teachers not adequately compensated.
There is no greater return to an economy or to a society than an educational system second to none.
On the question of the development of natural resources, I would pay as you go in the sense that they would be balanced and the power revenues would bring back sufficient money to finance the projects, in the same way as the Tennessee Valley.
I believe in the balanced budget.
And the only conditions under which I would unbalance the budget would be if there was a grave national emergency or a serious recession.
Otherwise, with a steady rate of economic growth - and Mr. Nixon and Mr. Rockefeller, in their meeting, said a five per cent economic growth would bring by 1962 ten billion dollars extra in tax revenues.
Whatever is brought in, I think that we can finance essential programs within a balanced budget, if business remains orderly.
Mr. Nixon, your comment?
Yes.
I think what Mr. Novins was referring to was not one of Senator Kennedy's speeches, but the Democratic platform, which did mention cutting the national debt.
I think, too, that it should be pointed out that of course it is not possible, particularly under the proposals that Senator Kennedy has advocated, either to cut the national debt or to reduce taxes.
As a matter of fact it will be necessary to raise taxes.
As Senator Kennedy points out that as far as his one proposal is concerned - the one for medical care for the aged - that that would be financed out of Social Security.
That, however, is raising taxes for those who pay Social Security.
He points out that he would make pay-as-you-go be the basis for our natural resources development.
Where our natural resources development - which I also support, incidentally, however - whenever you uh - uh - in - in - uh - appropriates money for one of these projects, you have to pay now and appropriate the money and the eh- while they eventually do pay out, it doesn't mean that you - the government doesn't have to put out the money this year.
And so I would say that in all of these proposals Senator Kennedy has made, they will result in one of two things: either he has to raise taxes or he has to unbalance the budget.
If he unbalances the budget, that means you have inflation, and that will be, of course, a very cruel blow to the very people - the older people - that we've been talking about.
As far as aid for school construction is concerned, I favor that, as Senator Kennedy did, in January of this year, when he said he favored that rather than aid to s- teacher salaries.
I favor that because I believe that's the best way to aid our schools without running any risk whatever of the federal government telling our teachers what to teach.
The next question to Vice President Nixon from Mr. Warren.
Mr. Vice President you mentioned schools and it was just yesterday I think you asked for a crash program to raise education standards, and this evening you talked about advances in education.
Mr. Vice President, you said - it was back in 1957 - that salaries paid to school teachers were nothing short of a national disgrace.
Higher salaries for teachers, you added, were important and if the situation wasn't corrected it could lead to a national disaster.
And yet, you refused to vote in the Senate in order to break a tie vote when that single vote, if it had been yes, would have granted salary increases to teachers.
I wonder if you could explain that, sir.
I'm awfully glad you ge- got that question because as you know I got into it at the last of my other question and wasn't able to complete the argument.
Uh - I think that the reason that I voted against having the federal government uh - pay teachers' salaries was probably the very reason that concerned Senator Kennedy when in January of this year, in his kick-off press conference, he said that he favored aid for school construction, but at that time did not feel that there should be aid for teachers' salaries - at least that's the way I read his remarks.
Now, why should there be any question about the federal government aiding s- teachers' salaries?
Why did Senator Kennedy take that position then?
Why do I take it now?
We both took it then, and I take it now, for this reason: we want higher teachers' salaries.
We need higher teachers' salaries.
But we also want our education to be free of federal control.
When the federal government gets the power to pay teachers, inevitably in my opinion, it will acquire the power to set standards and to tell the teachers what to teach.
I think this would be bad for the country; I think it would be bad for the teaching profession.
There is another point that should be made.
I favor higher salaries for teachers.
But, as Senator Kennedy said in January of this year in this same press conference, the way that you get higher salaries for teachers is to support school construction, which means that all of the local school districts in the various states then have money which is freed to raise the standards for teachers' salaries.
I should also point out this; once you put the responsibility on the federal government for paying a portion of teachers' salaries, your local communities and your states are not going to meet the responsibility as much as they should.
I believe, in other words, that we have seen the local communities and the state assuming more of that responsibility.
Teachers' salaries very fortunately have gone up fifty percent in the last eight years as against only a thirty-four percent rise for other salaries.
This is not enough; it should be more.
But I do not believe that the way to get more salaries for teachers is to have the federal government get in with a massive program.
My objection here is not the cost in dollars.
My objection here is the potential cost in controls and eventual freedom for the American people by giving the federal government power over education, and that is the greatest power a government can have.
Senator Kennedy's comment?
When uh - the Vice President quotes me in January, sixty, I do not believe the federal government should pay directly teachers' salaries, but that was not the issue before the Senate in February.
The issue before the Senate was that the money would be given to the state.
The state then could determine whether the money would be spent for school construction or teacher salaries.
On that question the Vice President and I disagreed.
I voted in favor of that proposal and supported it strongly, because I think that that provided assistance to our teachers for their salaries without any chance of federal control and it is on that vote that th- Mr. Nixon and I disagreed, and his tie vote uh - defeated his breaking the tie defeated the proposal.
I don't want the federal government paying teachers' salaries directly.
But if the money will go to the states and the states can then determine whether it shall go for school construction or for teachers' salaries, in my opinion you protect the local authority over the school board and the school committee.
And therefore I think that was a sound proposal and that is why I supported it and I regret that it did not pass.
Secondly, there have been statements made that uh - the Democratic platform would cost a good deal of money and that I am in favor of unbalancing the budget.
That is wholly wrong, wholly in error, and it is a fact that in the last eight years the Democratic Congress has reduced the appropri- the requests for the appropriations by over ten billion dollars.
That is not my view and I think it ought to be stated very clearly on the record.
My view is that you can do these programs - and they should be carefully drawn - within a balanced budget if our economy is moving ahead.
The next question to Senator Kennedy from Mr. Vanocur.
Senator, you've been promising the voters that if you are elected president you'll try and push through Congress bills on medical aid to the aged, a comprehensive minimum hourly wage bill, federal aid to education.
Now, in the August post-convention session of the Congress, when you at least held up the possibility you could one day be president and when you had overwhelming majorities, especially in the Senate, you could not get action on these bills.
Now how do you feel that you'll be able to get them in January -
Well as you take the bills -
- if you weren't able to get them in August?
If I may take the bills, we did pass in the Senate a bill uh - to provide a dollar twenty-five cent minimum wage.
It failed because the House did not pass it and the House failed by eleven votes.
And I might say that two-thirds of the Republicans in the House voted against a dollar twenty-five cent minimum wage and a majority of the Democrats sustained it - nearly two-thirds of them voted for the dollar twenty-five.
We were threatened by a veto if we passed a dollar and a quarter - it's extremely difficult with the great power that the president does to pass any bill when the president is opposed to it.
All the president needs to sustain his veto of any bill is one-third plus one in either the House or the Senate.
Secondly, we passed a federal aid to education bill in the Senate.
It failed to came to the floor of the House of Representatives.
It was killed in the Rules Committee.
