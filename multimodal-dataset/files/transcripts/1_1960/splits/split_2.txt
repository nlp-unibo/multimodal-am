And it is a fact in the August session that the four members of the Rules Committee who were Republicans joining with two Democrats voted against sending the aid to education bill to the floor of the House.
Four Democrats voted for it.
Every Republican on the Rules Committee voted against sending that bill to be considered by the members of the House of Representatives.
Thirdly, on medical care for the aged, this is the same fight that's been going on for twenty-five years in Social Security.
We wanted to tie it to Social Security.
We offered an amendment to do so.
Forty-four Democrats voted for it, one Republican voted for it.
And we were informed at the time it came to a vote that if it was adopted the President of the United States would veto it.
In my judgment, a vigorous Democratic president supported by a Democratic majority in the House and Senate can win the support for these programs.
But if you send a Republican president and a Democratic majority and the threat of a veto hangs over the Congress, in my judgment you will continue what happened in the August session, which is a clash of parties and inaction.
Mr. Nixon, comment?
Well obviously my views are a little different.
First of all, I don't see how it's possible for a one-third of a body, such as the Republicans have in the House and the Senate to stop two-thirds, if the two-thirds are adequately led.
I would say, too, that when Senator Kennedy refers to the action of the House Rules Committee, there are eight Democrats on that committee and four Republicans.
It would seem to me again that it is very difficult to blame the four Republicans for the eight Democrats' not getting a something through that particular committee.
I would say further that to blame the President in his veto power for the inability of the Senator and his colleagues to get action in this special session uh - misses the mark.
When the president exercises his veto power, he has to have the people upo- behind him, not just a third of the Congress.
Because let's consider it.
If the majority of the members of the Congress felt that these particular proposals were good issues - the majority of those who were Democrats - why didn't they pass them and send to the President and get a veto and have an issue?
The reason why these particular bills in these various fields that have been mentioned were not passed was not because the President was against them; it was because the people were against them.
It was because they were too extreme.
And I am convinced that the alternate proposals that I have, that the Republicans have in the field of health, in the field of education, in the field of welfare, because they are not extreme, because they will accomplish the end uh - without too great cost in dollars or in freedom, that they could get through the next Congress.
The next question to Vice President Nixon fa- from Mr. Fleming.
Mr. Vice President, do I take it then you believe that you can work better with Democratic majorities in the House and Senate than Senator Kennedy could work with Democratic majorities in the House and Senate?
I would say this: that we, of course, expect to pick up some seats in both in the House and the Senate.
Uh - We would hope to control the House, to get a majority in the House uh - in this election.
We cannot, of course, control the Senate.
I would say that a president will be able to lead - a president will be able to get his program through - to the effect that he has the support of the country, the support of the people.
Sometimes we - we get the opinion that in getting programs through the House or the Senate it's purely a question of legislative finagling and all that sort of thing.
It isn't really that.
Whenever a majority of the people are for a program, the House and the Senate responds to it.
And whether this House and Senate, in the next session is Democratic or Republican, if the country will have voted for the candidate for the presidency and for the proposals that he has made, I believe that you will find that the president, if it were a Republican, as it would be in my case, would be able to get his program through that Congress.
Now, I also say that as far as Senator Kennedy's proposals are concerned, that, again, the question is not simply one of uh - a presidential veto stopping programs.
You must always remember that a president can't stop anything unless he has the people behind him.
And the reason President Eisenhower's vetoes have been sustained - the reason the Congress does not send up bills to him which they think will be vetoed - is because the people and the Congress, the majority of them, know the country is behind the President.
Senator Kennedy.
Well, now let's look at these bills that the Vice President suggests were too extreme.
One was a bill for a dollar twenty-five cents an hour for anyone who works in a store or company that has a million dollars a year business.
I don't think that's extreme at all; and yet nearly two-thirds to three-fourths of the Republicans in the House of Representatives voted against that proposal.
Secondly was the federal aid to education bill.
It - it was a very uh - because of the defeat of teacher salaries, it was not a bill that uh - met in my opinion the need.
The fact of the matter is it was a bill that was less than you recommended, Mr. Nixon, this morning in your proposal.
It was not an extreme bill and yet we could not get one Republican to join, at least I think four of the eight Democrats voted to send it to the floor of the House - not one Republican - and they joined with those Democrats who were opposed to it.
I don't say the Democrats are united in their support of the program.
But I do say a majority are.
And I say a majority of the Republicans are opposed to it.
The third is medical care for the aged which is tied to Social Security, which is financed out of Social Security funds.
It does not put a deficit on the Treasury.
The proposal advanced by you and by Mr. Javits would have cost six hundred millions of dollars - Mr. Rockefeller rejected it in New York, said he didn't agree with the financing at all, said it ought to be on Social Security.
So these are three programs which are quite moderate.
I think it shows the difference between the two parties.
One party is ready to move in these programs.
The other party gives them lip service.
Mr. Warren's question for Senator Kennedy.
Senator Kennedy, on another subject, Communism is so often described as an ideology or a belief that exists somewhere other than in the United States.
Let me ask you, sir: just how serious a threat to our national security are these Communist subversive activities in the United States today?
Well, I think they're serious.
I think it's a matter that we should continue to uh - give uh - great care and attention to.
We should support uh - the laws which the United States has passed in order to protect us from uh - those who would destroy us from within.
We should sustain uh - the Department of Justice in its efforts and the F.B.I., and we should be continually alert.
I think if the United States is maintaining a strong society here in the United States, I think that we can meet any internal threat.
The major threat is external and will continue.
Mr. Nixon, comment?
I agree with Senator Kennedy's appraisal generally in this respect.
The question of Communism within the United States has been one that has worried us in the past.
It is one that will continue to be a problem for years to come.
We have to remember that the cold war that Mr. Khrushchev is waging and his colleagues are waging, is waged all over the world and it's waged right here in the United States.
That's why we have to continue to be alert.
It is also essential in being alert that we be fair; fair because by being fair we uphold the very freedoms that the Communists would destroy.
We uphold the standards of conduct which they would never follow.
And, in this connection, I think that uh - we must look to the future having in mind the fact that we fight Communism at home not only by our laws to deal with Communists uh - the few who do become Communists and the few who do become tra- fellow travelers, but we also fight Communism at home by moving against those various injustices which exist in our society which the Communists feed upon.
And in that connection I again would say that while Senator Kennedy says we are for the status quo, I do believe that he uh - would agree that I am just as sincere in believing that my proposals for federal aid to education, my proposals for health care are just as sincerely held as his.
The question again is not one of goals - we're for those goals - it's one of means.
Mr. Vanocur's question for Vice President Nixon.
Mr. Vice President uh - in one of your earlier statements you said we've moved ahead, we've built more schools, we've built more hospitals.
Now, sir, isn't it true that the building of more schools is a local matter for financing?
Uh - Were you claiming that the Eisenhower Administration was responsible for the building of these schools, or is it the local school districts that provide for it?
Not at all.
As a matter of fact your question brings out a point that I am very glad to make.
Too often in appraising whether we are moving ahead or not we think only of what the federal government is doing.
Now that isn't the test of whether America moves.
The test of whether America moves is whether the federal government, plus the state government, plus the local government, plus the biggest segment of all - individual enterprise - moves.
We have for example a gross national product of approximately five hundred billion dollars.
Roughly a hundred billion to a hundred and a quarter billion of that is the result of government activity.
Four hundred billion, approximately, is a result of what individuals do.
Now, the reason the Eisenhower Administration has moved, the reason that we've had the funds, for example, locally to build the schools, and the hospitals, and the highways, to make the progress that we have, is because this Administration has encouraged individual enterprise; and it has resulted in the greatest expansion of the private sector of the economy that has ever been witnessed in an eight-year period.
And that is growth.
That is the growth that we are looking for; it is the growth that this Administration has supported and that its policies have stimulated.
Senator Kennedy.
Well, I must say that the reason that the schools have been constructed is because the local school districts were willing to increase the property taxes to a tremendously high figure - in my opinion, almost to the point of diminishing returns in order to sustain these schools.
Secondly, I think we have a rich uh - country.
And I think we have a powerful country.
I think what we have to do, however, is have the president and the leadership set before our country exactly what we must do in the next decade, if we're going to maintain our security in education, in economic growth, in development of natural resources.
The Soviet Union is making great gains.
It isn't enough to compare what might have been done eight years ago, or ten years ago, or fifteen years ago, or twenty years ago.
I want to compare what we're doing with what our adversaries are doing, so that by the year 1970 the United States is ahead in education, in health, in building, in homes, in economic strength.
I think that's the big assignment, the big task, the big function of the federal government.
Can I have the summation time please?
We've completed our questions and our comments, and in just a moment, we'll have the summation time.
This will allow three minutes and twenty seconds for the summation by each candidate.
Three minutes and twenty seconds for each candidate.
Vice President Nixon, will you make the first summation?
Thank you, Mr. Smith.
Senator Kennedy.
First of all, I think it is well to put in perspective where we really do stand with regard to the Soviet Union in this whole matter of growth.
The Soviet Union has been moving faster than we have.
But the reason for that is obvious.
They start from a much lower base.
Although they have been moving faster in growth than we have, we find, for example, today that their total gross national product is only forty-four per cent of our total gross national product.
That's the same percentage that it was twenty years ago.
And as far as the absolute gap is concerned, we find that the United States is even further ahead than it was twenty years ago.
Is this any reason for complacency?
Not at all Because these are determined men.
They are fanatical men.
And we have to get the very most of uh - out uh - out of our economy.
I agree with Senator Kennedy completely on that score.
Where we disagree is in the means that we would use to get the most out of our economy.
I respectfully submit that Senator Kennedy too often would rely too much on the federal government, on what it would do to solve our problems, to stimulate growth.
I believe that when we examine the Democratic platform, when we examine the proposals that he has discussed tonight, when we compare them with the proposals that I have made, that these proposals that he makes would not result in greater growth for this country than would be the case if we followed the programs that I have advocated.
There are many of the points that he has made that I would like to comment upon.
The one in the field of health is worth mentioning.
Our health program - the one that Senator Javits and other Republican Senators, as well as I supported - is one that provides for all people over sixty-five who want health insurance, the opportunity to have it if they want it.
It provides a choice of having either government insurance or private insurance.
But it compels nobody to have insurance who does not want it.
His program under Social Security, would require everybody who had Social Security to take government health insurance whether he wanted it or not.
And it would not cover several million people who are not covered by Social Security at all.
Here is one place where I think that our program does a better job than his.
The other point that I would make is this: this downgrading of how much things cost I think many of our people will understand better when they look at what happened when - during the Truman Administration when the government was spending more than it took in - we found savings over a lifetime eaten up by inflation.
We found the people who could least afford it - people on retired incomes uh - people on fixed incomes - we found them unable to meet their bills at the end of the month.
It is essential that a man who's president of this country certainly stand for every program that will mean for growth.
And I stand for programs that will mean growth and progress.
But it is also essential that he not allow a dollar spent that could be better spent by the people themselves.
Senator Kennedy, your conclusion.
The point was made by Mr. Nixon that the Soviet production is only forty-four percent of ours.
I must say that forty-four percent and that Soviet country is causing us a good deal of trouble tonight.
I want to make sure that it stays in that relationship.
I don't want to see the day when it's sixty percent of ours, and seventy and seventy-five and eighty and ninety percent of ours, with all the force and power that it could bring to bear in order to cause our destruction.
Secondly, the Vice President mentioned medical care for the aged.
Our program was an amendment to the Kerr bill.
The Kerr bill provided assistance to all those who were not on Social Security.
I think it's a very clear contrast.
In 1935, when the Social Security Act was written, ninety-four out of ninety-five Republicans voted against it.
Mr. Landon ran in 1936 to repeal it.
In August of 1960, when we tried to get it again, but this time for medical care, we received the support of one Republican in the Senate on this occasion.
Thirdly, I think the question before the American people is: as they look at this country and as they look at the world around them, the goals are the same for all Americans.
The means are at question.
The means are at issue.
If you feel that everything that is being done now is satisfactory, that the relative power and prestige and strength of the United States is increasing in relation to that of the Communists; that we've b- gaining more security, that we are achieving everything as a nation that we should achieve, that we are achieving a better life for our citizens and greater strength, then I agree.
I think you should vote for Mr. Nixon.
But if you feel that we have to move again in the sixties, that the function of the president is to set before the people the unfinished business of our society as Franklin Roosevelt did in the thirties, the agenda for our people - what we must do as a society to meet our needs in this country and protect our security and help the cause of freedom.
As I said at the beginning, the question before us all, that faces all Republicans and all Democrats, is: can freedom in the next generation conquer, or are the Communists going to be successful?
That's the great issue.
And if we meet our responsibilities I think freedom will conquer.
If we fail, if we fail to move ahead, if we fail to develop sufficient military and economic and social strength here in this country, then I think that uh - the tide could begin to run against us.
And I don't want historians, ten years from now, to say, these were the years when the tide ran out for the United States.
I want them to say these were the years when the tide came in; these were the years when the United States started to move again.
That's the question before the American people, and only you can decide what you want, what you want this country to be, what you want to do with the future.
I think we're ready to move.
And it is to that great task, if we're successful, that we will address ourselves.
Thank you very much, gentlemen.
This hour has gone by all too quickly.
Thank you very much for permitting us to present the next president of the United States on this unique program.
I've been asked by the candidates to thank the American networks and the affiliated stations for providing time and facilities for this joint appearance.
Other debates in this series will be announced later and will be on different subjects.
This is Howard K. Smith.
Good night from Chicago.
