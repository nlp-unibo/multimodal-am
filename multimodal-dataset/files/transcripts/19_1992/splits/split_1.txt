better off he can refinance the home, because interest rates are down?
Is the senior citizen better off because inflation is not wiping out their family's savings?
I think they are.
Is the guy out of work better off?
Of course he's not, but he's not gonna be better off if we grow the government, if we invest, as Governor Clinton says, invest in more government.
You've got to free up the private sector.
You've got to let small businesses have more incentives.
For 3 months -- quarters I've been fighting, 3 quarters been fighting to get the Congress to pass some incentives for small business.
Capital gains, investment tax allowance, credit for first- time homebuyers.
And it's blocked by the Congress.
And then if a little of it comes my way, they load it up with Christmas trees and tax increases, and I have to stand up and favor the taxpayer.
I have to -- we have to talk about Ross Perot now or he'll get me, I'm sure.
Mr. Perot, on this issue that I have raised at the very beginning and we've been talking about, which is leadership, as president of the US, it concerns -- my reading of it, at least, my concerns about you, as expressed by folks in the polls and other places, it goes like this.
You had a problem with General Motors.
You took your $750 million and you left.
You had a problem in the spring and summer about some personal hits that you took as a potential candidate for president of the US and you walked out.
Does that say anything relevant to how you would function as president of the US?
I think the General Motors thing is very relevant.
I did everything I could to get General Motors to face its problems in the mid-'80s while it was still financially strong.
They just wouldn't do it, and everybody now knows the terrible price they're paying by waiting until it's obvious to the brain-dead that they have problems.
Now, hundreds, thousands of good, decent people, whole cities up here in this state are adversely impacted because they would not move in a timely way.
Our government is that point now.
The thing that I am in this race for is to tap the American people on the shoulder and to say to every single one of you, fix it while we're still relatively strong.
If you have a heart problem, you don't wait till a heart attack to address it.
So the General Motors experience is relevant.
At the point when I could not get them to address those problems, I had created so much stress in the board, who wanted to just keep the Lawrence Welk music going, that they asked to buy my remaining shares.
I sold them my remaining shares.
They went their way.
I went my way because it was obvious we had a complete disagreement about what should be done with the company.
But let's take my life in perspective.
Again and again, on complex, difficult tasks, I have stayed the course.
When I was asked by our government to do the POW project, within a year the Vietnamese had sent people into Canada to make arrangements to have me and my family killed.
And I had 5 small children, and my family and I decided we would stay the course, and we lived with that problem for 3 years.
Then I got into the Texas War on Drugs program and the big-time drug dealers got all upset.
Then when I had 2 people imprisoned in Iran, I could have left them there.
I could have rationalized it.
We went over, we got them out, we brought them back home.
And since then, for years, I have lived with the burden of the Middle East, where it's eye for an eye and tooth for a tooth country, in terms of their unhappiness with the fact that I was successful in that effort.
Again and again and again, in the middle of the night, at 2 or 3 o'clock in the morning, my government has called me to take extraordinary steps for Americans in distress, and again and again and again I have responded.
And I didn't wilt and I didn't quit.
Now, what happened in July we've covered again and again and again.
But I think in terms of the American people's concern about my commitment, I'm here tonight, folks; I never quit supporting you as you put me on the ballot in the other 26 states; and when you asked me to come back in, I came back in.
And talk about not quitting, I'm spending my money on this campaign; the 2 parties are spending your money, taxpayer money.
I put my wallet on the table for you and your children.
Over $60 million at least will go into this campaign to leave the American dream to you and your children, to get this country straightened out, because if anybody owes it to you, I do.
I've lived the American dream; I'd like for your children to be able to live it, too.
(Laughter)
Governor, do you have a response to the staying- the-course question about Mr. Perot?
I don't have any criticism of Mr. Perot.
I think what I'd like to talk about a minute, since you're asking the question, is the General Motors issue.
I don't think there's any question that the automobile executives made some errors in the 1980s, but I also think we should look at how much productivity has increased lately, how much labor has done to increase productivity and how much management has done.
And we're still losing a lot of auto jobs, in my judgment, because we don't have a national economic strategy that will build the industrial base of this country.
Just today I met with the presidents and the vice presidents of the Willow Run union here, near here.
They both said they were Vietnam veterans supporting me because I had an economic program to put them back to work.
We need an investment incentive to modernize plant and equipment; we've got to control the health care costs for those people -- otherwise we can't keep the manufacturing jobs here; and we need a tough trade policy that is fair, that insists on open markets in return for open markets.
We ought to have a strategy that will build the economic and industrial base.
So I think Mr. Perot was right in questioning the management practices.
But they didn't have much of a partner in government here as compared with the policies the Germans and the Japanese followed, and I believe we can do better.
That's one of the things I want to change.
I know that we can grow manufacturing jobs.
We did it in my state, and we can do it nationally.
Mr. President, do you have a response?
To this?
Yes.
Well, I wondered, when Governor Clinton was talking to the auto workers, whether he talked about his and Senator Gore's favoring CAFE standards, fuel efficiency standards, of 40 miles per gallon.
That would break the auto industry and throw a lot of people out of work.
As regarding Mr. Perot, I take back something I said about him.
I once said, in a frivolous moment, when he got out of the race: If you can't stand the heat, buy an air conditioning company.
And I take it back, because I think -- he said he made a mistake.
And the thing I find is if I make a mistake, I admit it.
I've never heard Governor Clinton make a mistake.
But one mistake he's made is fuel efficiency standards at 40 to 45 miles a gallon will throw many auto workers out of work, and you can't have it both ways.
There's a pattern here of appealing to the auto workers and then trying to appeal to the spotted owl crowds or the extremes in the environmental movement.
You can't do it as president: you can't have a pattern of one side of the issue one day and another the next.
So my argument is not with Ross Perot; it is more with Governor Clinton.
Governor, what about that charge?
Do you want it both ways on this issue?
Let's just talk about the CAFE standards -- that's the fuel efficiency standards.
They are now 27.5 miles per gallon per automobile fleet.
I never said -- and I defy you to find where I said -- I gave an extensive environmental speech in April, and I said that we ought to have a goal of raising the fuel efficiency standards to 40 miles a gallon.
I think that should be a goal.
I have never said we should write it into law if there is evidence that that goal cannot be achieved.
The Natl Science Foundation did a study which said it would be difficult for us to reach fuel efficiency standards in excess of 37 miles per gallon by the year 2000.
I think we should try to raise the fuel efficiency.
And let me say this.
I think we ought to have incentives to do it, I think we ought to push to do it.
That doesn't mean we have to write it into the law.
Look, I am a job creator, not a job destroyer.
It is the Bush administration that has had no new jobs in the private sector in the last 4 years.
In my state, we're leading the country in private sector job growth.
But it is good for America to improve fuel efficiency.
We also ought to convert more vehicles to compressed natural gas.
That's another way to improve the environment.
Mr. Perot, based on your experience at General Motors, where do you come down on this?
This has been thrown about, back and forth, during this campaign from the very beginning about jobs and CAFE standards.
Well, everybody's nibbling around the edges.
Let's go to the center of the bull's-eye, the core problem.
And believe me, everybody on the factory floor all over this country knows it.
You implement that NAFTA, the Mexican trade agreement, where they pay people a dollar an hour, have no health care, no retirement, no pollution controls, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera, and you're going to hear a giant sucking sound of jobs being pulled out of this country right at a time when we need the tax base to pay the debt and pay down the interest on the debt and get our house back in order.
We've got to proceed very carefully on that.
See, there's a lot I don't understand.
I do understand business.
I do understand creating jobs.
I do understand how to make things work.
And I got a long history of doing that.
Now, if you want to go to the core problem that faces everybody in manufacturing in this country, it's that agreement that's about to be put into practice.
It's very simple.
Everybody says it'll create jobs.
Yes, it'll create bubble jobs.
Now, you know, watch this -- listen very carefully to this.
One-time surge while we build factories and ship machine tools and equipment down there.
Then year after year for decades, they will have jobs.
And I finally -- I thought I didn't understand it -- called all the experts, and they said, oh, it'll be disruptive for 12 to 15 years.
We haven't got 12 days, folks.
We cannot lose those jobs.
They were eventually saying, Mexican jobs will eventually come to $7.50 an hour, ours will eventually go down to $7.50 an hour.
Makes you feel real good to hear that, right?
Let's think it through here.
Let's be careful.
I'm for free trade philosophically, but I have studied these trade agreements till the world has gone flat, and we don't have good trade agreements across the world.
I hope we'll have a chance to get into that tonight, because I can get right to the center of the bull's-eye and tell you why we're losing whole industries in this country.
Just for the record, though, Mr. Perot, I take it, then, from your answer, you do not have a position on whether or not enforcing the CAFE standards will cost jobs in the auto industry?
Oh, no, it will cost jobs, but that's not -- let me say this.
I'd rather, if you gave me 2 bad choices --
Okay.
I'd rather have some jobs left here than just see everything head south, see?
So that means -- in other words, you agree with President Bush; is that right?
No, I'm saying our principal need now is to stabilize the tax base, which is the job base, and create a growing, dynamic base.
Now please, folks, if you don't hear anything else I say, remember where the -- millions of people at work are our tax base.
Jim, one quick point.
If you confiscate the Forbes 400 wealth, take it all, you cannot balance the budget this year.
Kind of gets your head straight about where the taxes, year in and year out, have gotta come from.
Millions and millions of people at work.
Yes, sir.
I'm caught in the middle on NAFTA.
Ross says, with great conviction, he opposes the North American Free Trade Agreement.
I am for the North American Free Trade Agreement.
My problem with Governor Clinton, once again, is that one time he's gonna make up his mind, he sees some merit in it, but then he sees a lot of things wrong with it.
Then the other day he says he's for it, however then we've got to pass other legislation.
When you're president of the US, you cannot have this pattern of saying well, I'm for it but I'm on the other side of it.
And it's true on this and it's true on CAFE.
Look, if Ross were right when we get a free trade agreement with Mexico, why wouldn't they have gone down there now?
You have a differential in wages right now.
I just have an honest philosophical difference.
I think free trade is going to expand our job opportunity.
I think it is exports that have saved us when we're in a global slowdown, a connected global slowdown, a recession in some countries.
And it's free trade, fair trade that needs to be our hallmark, and we need more free trade agreements, not fewer.
Governor, quick answer on trade and I want to go on to something else.
(APPLAUSE)
I'd like to respond to that.
You know, Mr. Bush was very grateful when I was among the Democrats who said he ought to have the authority to negotiate an agreement with Mexico.
Neither I nor anybody else, as far a I know, agreed to give him our proxy to say that whatever he did was fine for the workers of this country and for the interests of this country.
I am the one who's in the middle on this.
Mr. Perot says it's a bad deal.
Mr. Bush says it's a hunky-dory deal.
I say on balance it does more good than harm if, if we can get some protection for the environment so that the Mexicans have to follow their own environmental standards, their own labor law standards, and if we have a genuine commitment to reeducate and retrain the American workers who lose their jobs and reinvest in this economy.
I have a realistic approach to trade.
I want more trade, and I know there are some good things in that agreement.
But it can sure be made better.
Let me just point out, just today in the Los Angeles Times Clyde Prestowitz, who was one of President Reagan's leading trade advisers and a life-long conservative Republican, endorsed my candidacy because he knows that I'll have a free and fair trade policy, a hard-headed, realistic policy, and not get caught up in rubber-stamping everything the Bush administration did.
If I wanted to do that, why would I run for president, Jim?
Anybody else can run the middle class down and run the economy in a ditch.
I want to change it.
(APPLAUSE)
We've got about 4 --
I think he made my case.
On the one hand, it's a good deal but on the other hand I'd make it better.
You can't do that as president.
You can't do it on the war, where he says well, I was with the minority but I guess I would have voted with the majority.
This is my point tonight.
We're talking about 2 weeks from now you've gotta decide who's gonna be president.
And there is this pattern that has plagued him in the primaries and now about trying to have it both ways on all these issues.
You can't do that.
And if you make a mistake, say you made a mistake and go on about your business, trying to serve the American people.
Right now we heard it.
Ross is against it.
I am for it.
He says on the one hand I am for it and on the other hand I may be against it.
The governor -- (APPLAUSE)
That's what's wrong with Mr. Bush.
His whole deal is you've gotta be for it or against it, you can't make it better.
I believe we can be better.
I think the American people are sick and tired of either/or solutions, people being pushed in the corner, polarized to extremes.
I want think they want somebody with common sense who can do what's best for the American people.
And I'd be happy to discuss these other issues, but I can't believe he is accusing me of getting on both sides.
He said trickle-down economics was voodoo economics; now he's it's biggest practitioner.
(Laughter and applause)  He promised -- he -- you know -- let me just say --
But I've always said trickle-down government is bad.
I could run this string out a long time, but remember this, Jim.
Those 209 Americans last Thursday night in Richmond told us they wanted us to stop talking about each other and start talking about Americans and their problems and their promise, and I think we ought to get back to that.
I'll be glad to answer any question you have, but this election ought to be about the American people.
(APPLAUSE)
Mr. Perot.
Is there an equal time rule tonight?
Yes.
Or do you just keep lunging in at will?
I thought we were going to have equal time, but maybe I just have to interrupt the other 2.
Is that the way it works?
No, it's -- Mr. Perot, you're doing fine.
Go ahead.
Whatever you want to say, say it.
Now that we've talked all around the problem about free trade, let's go again to the center of the bull's- eye.
Wait a minute.
I was going to ask -- I thought you wanted to respond to what we're talking about.
I do, I do.
All right.
I just want to make -- foreign lobbyists, this whole thing.
Our country has sold out to foreign lobbyists.
We don't have free trade.
Both parties have foreign lobbyists on leaves in key roles in their campaigns.
And if there's anything more unwise than that, I don't know what it is.
Every debate I bring this up, and nobody ever addresses it.
I would like for them to look you in the eye and tell you why they have people representing foreign countries working on their campaigns.
And you know, you've seen the list, I've seen the list, we won't go into the names, but no wonder they -- if I had those people around me all day every day, telling me it was fair and free, I might believe it.
But if I look at the facts as a businessman, it's so tilted, the first thing you ought to do is just say, guys, if you like these deals so well, we'll give you the deal you gave us.
Now, Japanese couldn't unload the cars in this country if they had the same restrictions we had, and on and on and on and on and on.
I suggest to you that the core problem -- 1 country spent $400 million lobbying in 1988, our country.
And it goes on and on.
And you look at a who's who in these campaigns around the 2 candidates.
They're foreign lobbyists taking leaves.
What do you think they're going to do when the campaign's over?
Go back to work at 30,000 bucks a month representing some other country.
I don't believe that's in the American people's interest.
I don't have a one of them, and I haven't taken a penny of foreign money, and I never will.
(APPLAUSE)
Mr. President, how do you respond to that?
Mr. Perot's made that charge several times.
The fact that you have people working in your campaign who are paid foreign lobbyists.
Most people that are lobbying are lobbying the Congress.
And I don't think there's anything wrong with an honest person who happens to represent an interest of another country for making his case.
That's the American way.
And what you're assuming is that that makes the recipient of the lobbying corrupt or the lobbyist himself corrupt.
I don't agree with that.
But if I found somebody that had a conflict of interest that would try to illegally do something as a foreign -- registered lobby, the laws cover this.
I don't know why -- I've never understood quite why Mr. Perot was so upset it, because one of the guys he used to have working for him, I believe, had foreign accounts.
Could be wrong, but I think so.
And as soon as I found it out, he went out the door.
(Laughter)
Well -- (APPLAUSE)  But I don't -- I think you got to look at the integrity and the honor of the people that are being lobbied and those that are lobbyists.
The laws protect the American taxpayer in this regard.
If the laws are violated so much, but to suggest if somebody represents a foreign country on anything, that makes him corrupt or against the taxpayer, I don't agree with that.
One quick relevant specific.
We're getting ready to dismantle the airlines industry in our country, and none of you know it.
And I doubt in all candor if the president knows it.
But this deal that we're doing with BAC and US Air and KLM and Northwest, guess who's on the president's campaign big time: a guy from Northwest.
This deal is terribly destructive to the US airline industry.
One of the largest industries in the world is the travel and tourist business.
We won't be making airplanes in this country 10 years from now
