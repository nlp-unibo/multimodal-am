Carter did and just like you're going to get -- you're going to end up with interest rates at 21%, and you're going to have inflation going through the roof.
Yes, we're having tough times, but we do not need to go back to the failed policies of the past, when you had a Democratic president and a spendthrift Democratic Congress.
(APPLAUSE)
Mr. Perot.
Jim, you permitted Mr. Bush to break the rules, he said, to defend the honor of the country.
What about the honor of my state?
We rank first in the country in job growth, we got the lowest spending, state and local, in the country, and the 2nd lowest tax burden.
And the difference between Arkansas and the US is that we're going in the right direction and this country's going in the wrong direction.
And I have to defend the honor of my state.
(APPLAUSE)
We've got a wash, according to my calculation.
We have a wash. And we go to Mr. Perot for one minute.
In other words, it's a violation of the rule, that's what I meant, Mr. Perot.
So I'm the only one that's untarnished at this point?
That's right.
You're clear.
(Laughter and applause)
I'm sure I'll do it before it's over.
(Laughter)  Key thing here, see, we all come up with images.
Images don't fix anything.
I think -- you know, I'm starting to understand it.
You stay around this long enough, you think about -- if you talk about it in Washington, you think you did it.
If you've been on television about it, you think you did it.
(Laughter)  What we need is people to stop talking and start doing.
Now, our real problem here is they both have plans that will not work.
The Wall Street Journal said your numbers don't add up.
And you can take it out on charts, you look at all the studies the different groups have done, you go out 4, 5, 6 years, we're still drifting along with a huge deficit.
So let's come back to harsh reality, and what I -- you know, everybody says, gee, Perot, you're tough.
I'm saying, well, this is not as tough as World War II and it's not as tough as the revolution.
And it's fair, shared sacrifice to do the right thing for our country and for our children.
And it will be fun if we all work together to do it.
All right.
This is the last question, and it goes to President Bush for a 2-minute answer.
And it will be asked by Helen.
Mr. President, why have you dropped so dramatically in the leadership polls, from the high 80s to the 40s?
And you have said that you will do anything you have to do to get reelected.
What can you do in 2 weeks to win reelection?
Well, I think the answer to why the drop, I think, has been the economy in the doldrums.
Why I'll win is I think I have the best plan of the 3 of us up here to do something about it.
Mine does not grow the government, it does not invest, have government invest.
It says we need to do better in terms of stimulating private business.
We got a big philosophical difference here tonight between one who thinks the government can do all these things through tax and spend, and one who thinks it ought to go the other way.
And so I believe the answer is, I'm going to win it because I'm getting into focus my agenda for America's renewal, and also I think that Governor Clinton's had pretty much of a free ride.
On looking specifically at the Arkansas record -- he keeps criticizing us, criticizing me, I'm the incumbent, fine.
But he's an incumbent, and we've got to look at all the facts.
They're almost at the bottom on every single category.
We can't do that to the American people.
And then, Helen, I really believe where people are going to ask this question about trust, because I do think there's a pattern by Governor Clinton of saying one thing to please one group, and then trying to please another group.
And I think that pattern is a dangerous thing to suggest would work for the Oval Office.
It doesn't work that way when you're president.
Truman is right.
The buck stops there.
And you have to make decisions even when it's against your own interest.
And I've done that.
It's against my political interest to say go ahead and go along with the tax increase, but I did what I thought was right at the time.
So I think people are going to be looking for trust and experience.
And then, I mentioned it the other night, I think if there's a crisis, people are going to say, well, George Bush has taken us through some tough crises, and we trust him to do that.
And so I'll make the appeal on a wide array of issues.
Also I got a philosophical difference.
I got to watch the clock here.
I don't think we're a declining nation.
The whole world has had economic problems.
We're doing better than a lot of the countries in the world.
And we're going to lead the way out of this economic recession across this world and economic slowdown here at home.
Mr. Perot, you have --
That's why I think I'll win.
Mr. Perot -- sorry, excuse me, sir.
Mr. Perot, you have one minute.
I'm the last one, right?
No, Governor Clinton has a minute after you.
Then we have the closing statements.
One minute after you.
Right.
I'm totally focussed on the fact that we may have bank failures and nobody answered it.
I'm totally focussed on the fact that we are still evading the issue of the Glaspie papers.
I'm totally focussed on the fact that we still could have enterprise zones, according to both parties, but we don't.
So I am still focussed on gridlock, I guess.
And I am also focussed on the fact that isn't it a paradox that we have the highest productivity in our workforce in the industrialized world and at the same time have the largest trade deficit, and at the same time rank behind 9 other nations in what we pay our most productive people in the world, and we're losing whole industries overseas.
Now, can't somebody agree with me that the government is breaking business's legs with these trade agreements?
They're breaking business's legs in a number of different ways.
We have an adversarial relationship that's destroying jobs and sending them overseas while we have the finest workers in the world.
Keep in mind a factory worker has nothing to do with anything except putting it together on the factory floor.
It's our obligation to make sure that we give him the finest products in the world to put together and we don't break his legs in the process.
Governor Clinton, one minute.
I really can't believe Mr. Bush is still trying to make trust an issue after "read my lips" and 15 million new jobs and embracing what he called voodoo economics and embracing an export enhancement program for farmers he threatened to veto and going all around the country giving out money in programs that he once opposed.
But the main thing is he still didn't get it, from what he said the other night to that fine woman on our program, the 209 people in Richmond.
They don't want us talking about each other.
They want us to talk about the problems of this country.
I don't think he'll be reelected because trickle down economics is a failure and he's offering more of it, and what he's saying about my program is just not true.
Look at the Republicans that have endorsed me.
High tech executives in Northern California.
Look at the 24 generals and admirals, retired, that have endorsed me, including the deputy commander of Desert Storm.
Look at Sarah Brady, Jim Brady's wife, President Reagan's press secretary, who endorsed me because he knuckled under to the NRA and wouldn't fight for the Brady Bill.
We've got a broad-based coalition that goes beyond party because I am going to change this country and make it better, with the help of the American people.
(APPLAUSE)
All right.
Now, that was the final question and answer and we now go to the closing statements.
Each candidate will have up to 2 minutes.
The order was determined by a drawing.
Governor Clinton, you're first.
Governor.
First, I'd like to thank the commission and my opponents for participating in these debates and making them possible.
I think the real winners of the debates were the American people.
I was especially moved in Richmond a few days ago when 209 of our fellow citizens got to ask us questions.
They went a long way toward reclaiming this election for the American people and taking their country back.
I want to say, since this is the last time I'll be on a platform with my opponents, that even though I disagree with Mr. Perot on how fast we can reduce the deficit and how much we can increase taxes on the middle class, I really respect what he's done in this campaign to bring the issue of deficit reduction to our attention.
I'd like to say to Mr. Bush, even though I've got profound differences with him, I do honor his service to our country.
I appreciate his efforts and I wish him well.
I just believe it's time to change.
I offer a new approach.
It's not trickle down economics.
It's been tried for 12 years and it's failed.
More people are working harder for less, 100,000 people a month losing their health insurance, unemployment going up, our economy slowing down.
We can do better.
And it's not tax and spend economics.
It's invest and grow, put our people first, control health care costs and provide basic health care to all Americans, have an education system 2nd to none and revitalize the private economy.
That is my commitment to you.
It is the kind of change that can open up a whole new world of opportunities to America as we enter the last decade of this century and move towards the 21st century.
I want a country where people who work hard and play by the rules are rewarded, not punished.
I want a country where people are coming together across the lines of race and region and income.
I know we can do better.
It won't take miracles and it won't happen overnight, but we can do much, much better if we have the courage to change.
Thank you very much.
(APPLAUSE)
President Bush, your closing statement, sir.
Three weeks from now -- 2 weeks from tomorrow, America goes to the polls and you're going to have to decide who you want to lead this country to economic recovery.
On jobs -- that's the number one priority, and I believe my program for stimulating investment, encouraging small business, brand-new approach to education, strengthening the American family, and, yes, creating more exports is the way to go.
I don't believe in trickle-down government, I don't believe in larger taxes and larger government spending.
On foreign affairs, some think it's irrelevant.
I believe it's not.
We're living in an interconnected world.
The whole world is having economic difficulties.
The US is doing better than a lot.
But we've got to do even better.
And if a crisis comes up, I ask who has the judgment and the experience and, yes, the character to make the right decision?
And, lastly, the other night on character Governor Clinton said it's not the character of the president but the character of the presidency.
I couldn't disagree more.
Horace Greeley said the only thing that endures is character.
And I think it was Justice Black who talked about great nations, like great men, must keep their word.
And so the question is, who will safeguard this nation, who will safeguard our people and our children?
I need your support, I ask for your vote.
And may God bless the US of America.
(APPLAUSE)
Mr. Perot, your closing statement, sir.
To the millions of fine decent people who did the unthinkable and took their country back in their own hands and put me on the ballot, let me pledge to you that tonight is just the beginning.
These next 2 weeks we will be going full steam ahead to make sure that you get a voice and that you get your country back.
This Thursday night on ABC from 8:30 to 9, Friday night on NBC from 8 to 8:30, and Saturday night on CBS from 8 to 8:30, we'll be down in the trenches under the hood working on fixin' the old car to get it back on the road.
Now, the question is, can we win?
Absolutely we can win, because it's your country.
Question really is who do you want in the White House.
It's that simple.
Now, you got to stop letting these people tell you who to vote for, you got to stop letting these folks in the press tell you you're throwing your vote away -- you got to start using your own head.
(APPLAUSE)  Then the question is, can we govern?
I love that one.
The "we" is you and me.
You bet your hat we can govern because we will be in there together and we will figure out what to do, and you won't tolerate gridlock, you won't tolerate endless meandering and wandering around, and you won't tolerate non-performance.
And, believe me, anybody that knows me understands I have a very low tolerance for non-performance also.
Together we can get anything done.
The president mentioned that you need the right person in a crisis.
Well, folks, we got one, and that one is a financial crisis.
Pretty simply, who's the best-qualified person up here on the stage to create jobs?
Make your decision and vote on November the 3rd.
I suggest you might consider somebody who's created jobs.
Who's the best person to manage money?
I suggest you pick a person who's successfully managed money.
Who's the best person to get results and not talk?
Look at the record and make your decision.
And, finally, who would you give your pension fund and your savings account to manage?
And, last one, who would you ask to be the trustee of your estate and take care of your children if something happened to you?
Finally, to you students up there -- God bless you, I'm doing this for you: I want you to have the American dream.
(APPLAUSE)  To the American people, I'm doing this because I love you.
That's it.
Thank you very much.
