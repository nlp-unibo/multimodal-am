10 times the national average and in fact according to the statistics coming from the Bush-Quayle Labor Dept, for the last 2 years in a role Bill Clinton's state has been number one among all 50 in the creation of jobs in the private sector.
By contrast, in the nation as a whole, during the last 4 years, it is the first time since the presidency of Herbert Hoover, that we have gone for a 4-year period with fewer jobs at the end of that 4-year period than we had at the beginning.
And look at manufacturing.
We have lost 1.4 million jobs in manufacturing under George Bush and Dan Quayle.
They have even -- we learned 2 weeks ago -- taken our tax dollars and subsidized the moving of US factories to foreign countries.
Now don't deny it because 60 Minutes and Nightline and the nation's newspapers have investigated this very carefully.
(Laughter.)
When are you going to stop using our tax dollars to shut down American factories and move 'em to foreign countries and throw Americans out of work?
Vice President Quayle.
Senator, don't always believe what you see on television.
(APPLAUSE.)
Let me tell you: the media have been wrong before.
We have never subsidized any country -- or any company to move from the US to Latin America.
You know full well the Caribbean Basin Initiative, you've supported that.
No.
That is a program there --
I voted against it.
You voted for it and your record --
No.
Okay.
Well, we'll -- we'll have a lot of interesting debate after this debate.
Our people will be glad to furnish the press, if they're interested, in Senator Gore's voting record on the Caribbean Basin Initiative.
But let's talk -- you know, you keep talking about trickle-down economics and all this stuff, about the worst economy since Hoover.
It is a bad economy.
It's a tough economy.
The question isn't -- it's not who you're going to blame; itâ€™s what are you going to do about it?
Your proposal it to raise $150 billion in taxes.
To raise $220 billion in new spending.
No.
How is raising taxes going to help small business?
How is raising taxes going to help the farmer?
How is raising taxes going to help the consumer in America?
I submit to you that raising taxes will make matters much, much worse.
(APPLAUSE.)
Admiral.
We now throw it open for discussion.
Admiral Stockdale, it's your turn to start the discussion.
Well, we've got to re -- we've got to clean out the barn, if I may quote my boss, and start getting this investment money on the street so we can get, and encourage entrepreneurs to build factories.
We -- the program is out there.
It's a put-together thing that requires some sacrifice, but not excessive, and we are willing to move forward in -- on a 5-year clip to put us back where we can start over and get -- get this nation straightened out.
Senator Gore, getting people back to work.
Well, the difference between the Perot- Stockdale plan and the Clinton-Gore plan is that Ross Perot's plan concentrates almost exclusively on balancing the budget and reducing the budget deficit, and the danger is that if that is the only goal it could throw our nation back into an even worse recession.
Bill Clinton and I have a detailed 5-year budget plan to create good jobs, cut the budget deficit in half, and eliminate the investment deficit in order to get our economy moving forward again.
We have a $20-billion infrastructure fund to create a nationwide network of high-speed rail, for example, and what are called information superhighways to open up a whole universe of knowledge for our young people and to help our universities and companies that rely on new advances in the information revolution.
We also have tax incentives for investment in job-creating activities, not the kind of encouragement for short-term rip-offs like the proposal that we have had from George Bush.
But I want to return and say one more time: you have used our tax dollars to subsidize the recruitment of US companies to move overseas and throw Americans out of work.
In Decaturville, Tennessee, not very far from my home, a factory was shut down right there when they were solicited by officials paid with US taxpayers' money, and then the replacement workers in a foreign country were trained with our tax dollars and then their imports were subsidized coming back into the US.
When are you going to stop that program?
We do not have any program that encourages companies to close down here and to go and invest on foreign soil.
That is absolutely outrageous.
Of course American businesses do have business abroad; we've got global competition.
We want businesses to expand.
Do you realize this, Senator, that every job that's overseas there's 3 jobs back here to support that.
But never have we ever, nor would we, support the idea of someone closing down a factory here and moving overseas.
That's just totally ridiculous.
It's going on right now; it happened in Tennessee, in Decaturville, Tennessee.
When George Bush went to Nashville, the employees who lost their jobs asked to meet with --
I want to get back --
I talked with them.
Let me tell you what they're feeling.
Some of them are in their 50s and 60s.
They want to know where they're going to get new jobs when their jobs have been destroyed.
And there are 1.4 million manufacturing jobs that have been lost because of the policies of you and George Bush.
Do you seriously believe that we ought to continue the same policies that have created the worst economy since the Great Depression?
I hope that when you talked to those people you said: and the first thing that Bill Clinton and I are going to do is to raise $150 billion in new taxes.
You got that wrong, too.
And the first -- that is part of your plan.
No, it's not.
A hundred and fifty billion dollars in new taxes.
Well, you're going to disavow your plan.
Listen, what we're proposing --
You know what you're doing, you know what you're doing?
You're pulling a Clinton.
(Laughter)  And you know what a Clinton is?
And you know what Clinton is?
A Clinton is, is what he says -- he says one thing one day and another thing the next day -- you try to have both sides of the issues.
The fact of the matter is that you are proposing $150 billion in new taxes.
No.
And I hope that you talk to the people in Tennessee --
No, we're not.
-- and told them that --
You can say it all you want but it doesn't make it true.
-- going to have new taxes.
I hope you talked to them about the fact that you were going to increase spending to $220 billion.
I'm sure what you didn't talk to them about was about how we're going to reform the health care system, like the president wants to do.
He wants to go out and to reform the health care system so that every American will have available to them affordable health insurance.
I'm sure one other thing that you didn't talk to them about, Senator, and that is legal reform, because your position on legal reform is the status quo.
And yet you talk about foreign competition.
Why should an American company have to spend 15 to 20 times on product liability and insurance costs compared to a company in Japan or a company in Germany or somewhere else?
That's not right.
We have product liability reform legislation on Capitol Hill.
It will create jobs.
And a Democratic Congress won't pass it.
(APPLAUSE)
Okay.
I think it's time to move on to our next topic.
All 3 of you gentlemen have some expertise in defense and the armed forces.
Vice President Quayle and Senator Gore both served on the Senate Armed Services Committee.
Admiral Stockdale, of course, has a very distinguished military career.
With the end of the Cold War, everyone agrees that there are going to be major cuts.
They've already started in the defense budget.
But this country has a long history of neglecting its military needs in peace time and then paying for it with heavy casualties when we're caught unprepared.
How much of a defense cut is safe?
What happens to the people who are forced to leave the military services, or if they lose their jobs because they're working in defense industries.
I think we start with Senator Gore this time.
Bill Clinton and I support a strong national defense.
He and I have both fought for change within the Democratic Party as well as within the country.
In the aftermath of the Cold War, the definition of strong national defense has obviously changed somewhat.
For example, George Bush wants to maintain at least 150,000 American soldiers in Europe, even though World War II ended 50 years ago.
Bill Clinton and I agree with so many military experts who believe that it is time for the Europeans, who are so much wealthier now and more powerful than they were at the end of World War II to start picking up a little more of that tab themselves and not rely so exclusively on the US taxpayers for the defense of Europe.
We believe that we can make savings in our defense budget and at the same time, improve our national security.
Now, for those who are affected by the cutbacks, whether they come from George Bush or Bill Clinton and me -- the difference is, Bill Clinton and I have a defense conversion program so that those who won the Cold War will not be left out in the cold.
We want to put them to work, building an infrastructure and an economy here in this country for the '90's and the next century.
Vice President Quayle.
We won the Cold War because we invested in national security.
We won the Cold War because we invested in our military.
We didn't win the Cold -- we won the Cold War because we invested in national security.
We won the Cold War because America had the political will and made the right decisions.
Yes, we can make the cuts in defense and we have.
Bill Clinton wants to cut defense another $60 billion.
I'd say to the defense workers in California and elsewhere, a $60 billion defense cut is going to cut a lot of jobs out.
Yes, we are making a conversion and we can go to a civil space rather than having defense -- or the defense industry.
Well, let me say this: we would not have won the Cold War if we had listened to Senator Gore and his crowd, and had supported a nuclear freeze.
If you would have supported that attitude -- if you would have supported that attitude, we would not have won the Cold War.
We won the Cold War because we invested and we went forward.
(APPLAUSE.)
Mr. -- Admiral Stockdale, please.
Yes, thanks.
The numbers, in terms of the dollar cuts, as they stand on our plans now, show us almost the same as the vice president's.
But we'd note that Mr. -- Governor Clinton's plan is almost twice as much a cut as either one of us.
I've been through the end of World War II, and the surprise beginning of Korea, to see how we -- it cost us more money because we overcut the defense budget in the first place.
I don't say that -- (APPLAUSE.)
So I think that should be eyed with great suspicion, people that are really kicking the props out from under our grand military establishment prematurely.
Now there's other differences between the Perot approach and what we see up here on either side of me, and that has to do with we want to focus our interests, economic and military, more to the Pacific.
We figure that we are generally going along with any sort of a troop removal from Europe.
So that's still another face of this puzzle.
Senator Gore, would you like to start the discussion period on this topic?
Yeah, I'd like to respond first to you, Admiral Stockdale.
Under the details of our 5-year budget plan, we do propose more in defense cuts than George Bush and Dan Quayle, but only 5 % more.
Admiral Crowe, who I think was one of your classmates in Annapolis --
Oh, yes, I've known him --
-- has endorsed --
-- 50 years.
-- the military portions of our plan, even though he was the chairman of the Joint Chiefs under George Bush, and John White has endorsed the economic aspects of our plan, even though I believe he was the architect of Ross Perot's economic plan.
Now when I heard George Bush say at the convention in Houston, that when he heard the phrase "we won the Cold War," it made him wonder who the "we" was.
Well, I want to tell you, President Bush, the "we" is the people of the US of America.
This wasn't a partisan victory that came suddenly, a few months after you took the oath of office.
This started with Harry Truman and it was a bipartisan effort from the very beginning.
George Bush taking credit for the Berlin Wall coming down is like the rooster taking credit for the sunrise.
(APPLAUSE.)
And I want to, I want to add -- I want to add one other thing, because in the debate a few nights ago, I think President Bush made a very serious misstatement of fact in response to Ross Perot.
It was kind of a little lecture he gave to Ross Perot when he said those SS-18s are gone, Ross, that's done.
He -- he reached a deal with Boris Yeltsin to completely remove them so we can all sleep safely without any fear tonight.
But you know what?
They thought they were going to get that deal, but when he took the person in charge of the negotiations out of the State Dept and put him in charge of the reelection campaign, the deal unraveled and now there is no START II deal at all.
In fact there are serious problems.
Isn't it a fact, Dan, that every single one of those SS-18s is still there, in the silos, and under the START I treaty, only half of the silos are supposed to be dismantled, and there is no deal to get rid of the other half?
Didn't the president make a mistake there?
Vice President Quayle, please.
The president does have a commitment from Boris Yeltsin to eliminate the SS-18s.
That is a commitment to --
Is it an agreement?
It is a commitment.
Oh.
(Laughter)
Let's talk about, let's talk about --
Well, he said he'd --
Let him talk, Senator.
Lighten up here, Al.
(Laughter and applause)
Go ahead.
Let's talk about getting agreements.
You know, the president of the US doesn't just negotiate with your friends in Congress; the president of the US deals on the international scene.
He's got to deal with the president of Russia, he's got to deal with the chancellor of Germany, the prime minister of Britain, the president of France, the prime minister of Japan -- he's got to deal with a whole host of leaders around the world.
And the leaders sit down and they will negotiate, and they will come to agreements with people that they trust.
And this is a fundamental problem with Bill Clinton, is trust and character.
It is not the issue of how he avoided military service 20-some years ago; it's the fact -- it's the fact that he does not tell the truth about it.
He first said he didn't get an induction notice, then we find out that he did; he said he didn't have an ROTC slot, then we find out he did; he said he didn't use Senator Fulbright's office for special influence, then we find out that he did.
These are inconsistencies.
Bill Clinton has trouble telling the truth.
And he will have a very difficult time dealing with somebody like President Yeltsin or Chancellor Kohl or Prime Minister Major or President Mitterrand, because truth and integrity are prerequisites to being president of the US.
(APPLAUSE)
I want to respond to that, I want to respond to that.
George Bush, in case you've forgotten, Dan, said "Read my lips -- no new taxes."
(Laughter and applause)  And you know what?
I didn't think I was going to hear that tonight.
Hold on, hold on, let me finish.
Okay.
He also said he wanted to be the environmental president; then he went on to say he wanted to be the education president.
Then he said that he wouldn't raise taxes again -- no, never, ever, ever.
Then the next day his spokesman, Marlin Fitzwater, came out and said that's not a pledge.
Then 2 weeks ago he said that after the election, if you win, then James Baker's going to go back to be secretary of state; then a week later, in the debate a few nights ago, he said, no, after the election, if we win, James Baker is going to be in charge of domestic policy.
Which is it, Dan?
Is he going to -- what's your role in this going to be?
(Laughter and applause)
Well, we'll have to move on to another topic.
Let me --
Sorry, Mr. Vice President.
I don't have time to respond to that?
You'll get plenty of chance to respond, so don't worry.
Okay, you're the moderator.
I was under the assumption that when the thing is like that that you get a chance to respond.
Well, we ran out of time; according to the agreement, it's time to move on.
And I want to stick to the agreement.
Okay.
Well, you got the last word on that, but we'll come back to it.
But you'll have a chance -- I can see what's happening here: we throw out the topic and then we drift.
But that's okay, because I think it's making for a healthy exchange.
(Laughter)  The only thing I would ask of you --
I'm enjoying it.
(Laughter)
The only thing I would ask of you gentlemen is that when we get to the discussion period, whoever talks first be considerate of the others, because you have a tendency to filibuster.
Look over there.
(Laughter)
Okay, I'm not pointing any fingers.
Let's talk about the environment -- we'll get away from controversy.
(Laughter)  Everyone wants a safe and clean environment, but there's an ongoing conflict between environmental protection and the need for economic growth and jobs.
So the point I throw out on the table is, how do you resolve this conflict between protection of the environment and growth in jobs, and why has it taken so long to deal with basic problems, such as toxic waste dumps, clean air and clean water?
And, Vice President Quayle, it's your turn to start first.
Hal, that's a false choice.
You don't have to have a choice between the environment and jobs -- you can have both.
Look at the president's record: clean air legislation passed the Democratic Congress because of the leadership of George Bush.
It is the most comprehensive clean air act in our history.
We are firmly behind preserving our environment, and we have a good record with which to stand.
The question comes about: What is going to be their position when it comes to the environment?
I say it's a false choice.
You ought to ask somebody in Michigan, a UAW worker in Michigan, if they think increasing the CAFE standards, the fuel economy standards, to 45 miles a gallon is a good idea -- 300,000 people out of work.
You ought to talk to the timber people in the Northwest where they say that, well, we can only save the owl, forget about jobs.
You ought to talk to the coal miners.
They're talking about putting a coal tax on.
They're talking about a tax on utilities, a tax on gasoline and home heating oil -- all sorts of taxes.
No, Hal, the choice isn't the environment and jobs.
With the right policies -- prudent policies -- we can have both.
(APPLAUSE)
Admiral Stockdale.
I read Senator Gore's book about the environment and I don't see how he could possibly pay for his proposals in today's economic climate.
(APPLAUSE)  You know, the Marshall Plan of the environment, and so forth.
And also, I'm told by some experts that
